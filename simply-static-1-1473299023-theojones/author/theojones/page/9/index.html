	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The structure of Facebook and other social media services is quite malformed if you want serious discussion about complex issues. Here is how design decisions in Facebook encourage shitposting</p>
<ul>
<li>The &#8220;like&#8221; and the &#8220;share&#8221; system (combined with the lack of a downvote mechanism) provides positive reinforcement to people who post low-quality content. There will be a few likeminded people who like the stuff you share, even if it it is disliked by almost everyone else</li>
<li>Long-form content is second-class. While FB isn&#8217;t as extreme here as Twitter, its design still makes short posts and image posts more visible. This encourages memes and one liners over actual discussion.</li>
<li>Facebook bubbles users. It gives users what they have interacted with and liked in the past and filters out all of the other posts from their feed. This is done both on a per user basis and a site-wide basis. This limits exposure to opposing views.</li>
</ul>
<p>The effects of these tendencies on the broader world of political discourse are pernicious. People are no longer using traditional media sources, and are instead relying on social media more and more.</p>

		<h2 class="entry-title"><a href="https://microblog.theojones.name/2016/05/17/lets-say-that-you-are-a-drug-company/" rel="bookmark">Lets say that you are a drug company&#8230;</a></h2>	</header><!-- .entry-header -->

	
	
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Lets say that you are a drug company. Your drug for $disease has been successful, but your exclusive marketing rights and patents are about to expire. What do you do? Simple. Create a variant of it with a bit of dye or something else that is non-clinically active. Run a clinical trial on that sucker. But this time focus it on <i>women</i> (or the demographic of your choice). The trial will almost certainly be successful, because you know your drug works on the population as a whole, and women kind of have a few similarities with the human population as a whole. Now you have a drug that treats $disease in <i>women</i>. Exclusive marketing rights time.</p>
<p>This pretty much happens straight up with <a href="http://www.webcitation.org/6hZjEPzQL">so called Me-Too drugs</a> [1. now dead original link was https://www.optum.com/resources/library/metoodrugs.html archived link at http://www.webcitation.org/6hZjEPzQL and http://archive.is/I5l0i]. But the same general tactic is good for think-tanks who want to mislead people.</p>
<p>On social media I saw, the following article linked, with the following section quoted<br />
http://www.progressivepolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2015.11-Gerwin_The-Trans-Pacific-Partnership-and-Small-Business_Boosting-Exports-and-Inclusive-Growth.pdf</p>
<blockquote><p>The average women- owned exporting firm, for example, employs over five times more workers and pays an average salary almost $17,000 higher than non-exporting firms owned by women&#8230;..</p></blockquote>
<p> [2. Archived link at http://www.webcitation.org/6iWfrtBnt ]<br />
Trade improves gender equality. Sounds good.</p>
<p>At first I was wondering what causes the gender aspect here. Do cross culture differences suppress the effect of sexism? And then I realized that the article was a non-peer reviewed article from a think-tank with a strong view on trade (the Progressive Policy Institute). What do we know about ideological think tanks? Ah yes. They exist to promote their political views. If this means being misleading, then so be it. I got really skeptical when the paper had no comparison to other demographic groups (except minorities).</p>
<p>I then checked the source for that article, which was this article from the Census Bureau http://www2.census.gov/econ/sbo/07/sbo_export_report.pdf [3. Archived link at http://www.webcitation.org/6iWgU3GBH ]</p>
<p>Turns out the PPI did the drug company trick mentioned above. That number is purely an artifact of the fact that exporting firms are larger than purely domestic ones. Actually, women owned exporters are actually smaller companies than their man owned counterparts (seems to have something to do with the strong performance of veteran owned firms, as a strong majority of veterans are men).</p>
<p>In statistics this type of manipulation is pretty easy in cases where you can divide things up into arbitrary subgroups. See also the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modifiable_areal_unit_problem">modifiable areal unit problem</a> [4. Archived link at http://archive.is/LI9Nh].</p>

		<p>I am Clinton voting and sympathetic to the goals of the left, but, I have developed a <em><strong>strong</strong></em> dislike for the left as currently exists. There is a really nasty political culture, particularly on the campus left. </p>
<p>There are people who can&#8217;t fathom the possibility that open discourse is important or that they could be wrong on a policy issue. So, they want to shut down all discourse and deal with others through intimation. Its gotten to the point that open discourse and free speech are becoming conservative values that the left on the whole is against, at least from my vantage point. These people don&#8217;t even attempt to understand why people believe what they believe, and think that anyone who is less left wing than them is debauched evil scum, or ill-informed.<br />
And worse of all, they can&#8217;t realize that even when the values of it are put aside, this type of strategy is self-destructive because the changes they are making to the social norms that govern political discourse will be used against them eventually. They think that they can limit harassment and vilification and no-platforming and personal destruction of their political opponents to just their enemies.<br />
And as Bernie&#8217;s campaign shows this toxic culture is escaping the left-wing enclaves that are its home and leaking very quickly into the political mainstream.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I think there is a big issue in the structure of Twitter, Facebook and other social media content silos. These services try to be a jack of all trades, and wind up being a master of none.</p>
<p>There are five roles that a communication service can fulfill,</p>
<ol>
<li>1 to 1 communication between two individuals (ie. personal email)</li>
<li>one to many communication (ie. a newspaper)</li>
<li>a group of like-minded individuals coming together to discuss a matter of common interest (ie. an Internet forum for conservatives)</li>
<li>a community of people with, disparate views to come together and discuss those differences (ie. a broader focus Internet forum)</li>
<li>core infrastructure that serves a bunch of unrelated users with different interests and goals (ie. a webhost).</li>
</ol>
<p>Your typical content silo tries to be all five, and this creates a lot of problems, and tensions.</p>
<h3 id="differing-expectations-and-sealions">Differing Expectations and Sealions</h3>
<p>This creates people with different expectations of what type of community they are dealing with. There are a lot of different communities and users with different goals. And sometimes these communities don’t get along. The structure of social media systems forces them into the same silo. This creates perverse outcomes.</p>
<p>Have you heard of the concept of sealioning? It refers the the tendency of a comment made on Twitter on a controversial subject, to attract a negative response from partisans on the issue. If you make a Tweet on a controversial subject, people will try to respond to you , and this can create some hostile dynamics. The phrase originates from <a href="http://wondermark.com/1k62/">a cartoon by David Malki</a>. In the cartoon, one character insults sealions in a conversation with another character. An anthropomorphic sealion then enters the conversation, and requests that the insulter justify the comment, and follows the insulter home.</p>
<p>The phrase <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/sea-lioning">came to prominence</a> during the whole #GamerGate shitshow. But it describes a situation that has preexisted that tirefire, and which still happens on many other issues. <a href="http://inthesetimes.com/article/18850/kind-of-discourse-we-need">Take the 2016 presidential election</a>, and the discussion about it on Twitter. Support a candidate, or oppose one vocally on Twitter, and you run the chance of getting a negative response from the partisans for that candidate. The supporters of both Trump and <a href="http://www.vox.com/2016/2/4/10918710/berniebro-bernie-bro">Sanders</a> are particularly known <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/10/here-comes-the-berniebro-bernie-sanders/411070/">for their aggression on social media</a> .</p>
<p>And then there is the strongly related phenomenon of the <a href="https://medium.com/@randileeharper/solving-twitter-dogpiles-7d7b102116c8#.f1q6hlo5i">Twitter dogpile</a>. In a dog-pile, someone writes a tweet that gets a lot of attention from other tweeters. Those angry at the offending tweet then send their responses to the original tweeter. The result is a flooding of the original tweeter with angry messages.</p>
<p>The tension between the different roles of Twitter is where the sealioning, dogpiling, and related issues comes from. Twitter (and other social media platforms) is at once functioning as a public forum for public discussion, and at once as a personalized medium. And its not navigating that impasse very well.</p>
<p>Remember the original cartoon. The sealion followed the person who insulted the sealion home home. And that’s what the people who complain about sealioning think is happening. Their vision of the purpose of Twitter is one in which they are dealing with like-minded people, or broadcasting their ideas to people who agree with them. Their conception of what Twitter is marks off 1,2,and three on my roles of a communication service, but they aren’t using Twitter for roles 4 and five. They look at their notifications and, like the sealioned person in the cartoon, see someone intruding on their home. Meanwhile, the person who is responding to the Tweet, thinks of Twitter as a way for people with disagreeing viewpoints to interact, and therefore thinks it is perfectly fine to rebut the person talking about how evil sealions are.</p>
<p>Considering the structure of Twitter, both have a point. The situation is at an impasse, and the structure of the platform tries to suit all possible uses at the expense of fulfilling none of them.</p>
<h3 id="censorship">Censorship</h3>
<p>This also creates some of the controversies over censorship. Social networks are in large part acting as core infrastructure, while also serving as content and communities on top of that infrastructure.</p>
<p>There are communities, and there are protocols. Infrastructure means there must be what in a decentralized system would be a protocol for communication. Protocols tend to have a strong tendency towards natural monopolies due to network effects. A communication protocol is only useful to the extent that other people are using it. Unless there are very strong intensives the other way, you will use the most popular protocol. The market will therefore become quite concentrated and non-competitive.</p>
<p>This has happened on lower levels of Internet-based protocols. Gopher lost the competition to HTTP. And so on.</p>
<p>In the pre-social media world, there was a separation between the communities themselves and the This website is a discrete community, and the VPS I host it on implements various protocols to allow users to get access to the content. But, as long as everyone agrees on the protocol itself, there can be competition on the higher levels of the system. There can be many blogs and fora with different owners served over HTTP. There can even be competition on the infrastructure level.</p>
<p>The multiple roles of most social networks serve to combine protocol with implementation. This makes the type of diversity of different communities and implementations that dominated the pre-social web impossible. It serves to concentrate substantial power over the Internet and the discourse that happens on it into the owners of these systems.</p>
<p>And its important infrastructure. Social media sites contain so much of Internet discourse that if your opinion is blocked from them, then you are at a severe disadvantage in getting it out. They are so powerful that by taking sides on political issues they could alter the discourse on those issues quite a bit. Its safe to say that both Sanders and Trump are social media candidates– if social media wasn’t available to them, then they couldn’t sustain their campaign solely on traditional media. FiveThirtyEight has a <a href="http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/facebook-primary/">post up showing the social media mentions of each candidate for president</a> , if you want a visualization of this. Major social media websites taking sides on political issues could very quickly alter the whole political discourse of the country. Social media services and other Internet infrastructure.</p>
<p>The real problem and controversy comes from the dual roles of social media —- Twitter/Facebook/Tumblr isn’t purely infrastructure. They are also communities. The infrastructure role of these services pushes them in the direction of needing ideological diversity and tolerance for a wide range of varying viewpoints.</p>
<p>The community-like nature of these pushes them in the other direction.</p>
<p>This is in large part because the different communities can affect each other. If my webhost also hosted a neo-nazi blog, it wouldn’t affect my site very much. The neo-nazis could read their site, and my readers could read mine. But if a bunch of neo-nazis started using Twitter, then there would be clear leakage on the other users. And this could damage the reputation of Twitter. One remark that I’ve seen a few times on this issue: If a bunch of Hells Angles start attending your bar, then you become a Hells Angles bar unless you kick them out. If you are in the same tightly knit Internet community as some pretty terrible people – then those terrible people are going to affect you. Again an impasse created by the dual roles of Twitter.</p>
<h3 id="toxic-communities">Toxic communities</h3>
<p>The big social networks also tend to have some pretty nasty issues with toxic subcultures, and sub-communities. Tumblr is probably the worst in this vein. The site’s fandom and social justice sub-community wars have given the site a name in the broader Internet community.</p>
<p>And on Twitter you get toxic groups forming a collective group and becoming a menace to other users. This type of issue is definitely seen with tire-fires such as #GamerGate where you get a whole sub-community form that is a big dump of toxic on the rest of the users of the system.</p>
<p>The same leakage issue created by dual roles that I mentioned earlier applies here. When you have toxic neighbors, its hard to avoid their effects on your usage of the service.</p>
<p>But the multiple communication services roles problem creates another issue here. It becomes very difficult for the sub-communities to self-moderate. In a proper Internet forum the ban-hammer is always a option, and in well functioning communities often applied. Due to the broad,based infrastructure-like roles of the social networks, the banhammer is applied very lightly. Sub-communities can not eject their malefactors. The Bernie Sanders supporter community on Twitter can not eject the toxic berniebros that engage in crude and sexist behavior. If instead of Twitter, they were on an Internet forum dedicated towards their politics – the gentle, warm glow of the banhammer could be applied to these types. Both the reputation of the wider community and the ability for proper discourse to happen is greatly damaged.</p>
<h3 id="path-forward">Path Forward</h3>
<p>In the short run, social media services can address this issue by <a href="https://medium.com/art-marketing/putting-out-the-twitter-trashfire-3ac6cb1af3e#.8mten26a4">adding features</a> to their services that allow users to have more control over the messages they see. This control can allow users to adjust the nature of the service as used by them so that it is better suited to them. This could take the form of opt in filtering, options to adjust the user interface, options to suppress notifications, and opt-in blocklists.</p>
<p>However, this type of adjustment will not work in the long run . I think these problems are an inherent problem in the design of current social networking services, one that will eventually lead to their decline, and replacement with services that handle each type of Internet communication more individually. Solving these structural issues will 1) require returning to the decentralization of the pre-social media web, 2) replacing current social networks with general protocols, and 3) creating separate protocols for each major type of communication .</p>
<p>The reason Twitter type services gained popularity is more their ease of use, then their structure. Users want a presence on the web, one that is personalized, and that allows them to connect with others. The old, pre-social network web, had fewer of these issues. All of the major communication functions were well-separated. Discrete communities were isolated.</p>
<p>The problem here was ease of use. Getting an Internet presence outside of the use of social media services takes substantial technical skill. Skill that most users do not have. The first feature that a good social network replacement should have is ease of use.</p>
<p>Decentralization is also important. Current centralized social networking websites, such as Facebook have many flaws. They have persistent privacy issues and breaches. Their moderation policies are often problematic and applied arbitrarily. These systems are vulnerable to censorship and government manipulation. The risks of this to privacy are shown by the NSA leaks. The risks to <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2238519/Facebook-bans-picture-woman-reclining-bathtub--shows-elbow.html">free speech are shown by how, when under pressure from the Turkish government Facebook restricted posts advocating</a> Kurdish independence and “Any attack on Ataturk [Turkey’s first president]”. With a centralized structure these issues of government interference are almost unavoidable. The nature of these networks also means that there is little ability for the user to modify and customize the interface because all of the code runs on the server, and because this code is not open source. This is part of the reason why Facebook has to roll out interface changes to all users, often with many dissatisfied users. Some projects have tried to improve the Facebook interface by running client-side software that modifies the HTML and JavaScript produced by Facebook, but this method is error prone. A distributed social network built around a single protocol that allows different implementations of the system, running on different servers would fix these issues. A decentralized social network would lessen all of the issues I discussed. If individuals run their own servers, governments would have a hard time controlling these servers. A decentralized system would allow many different implementations and configurations of the system to run. The users would be allowed to choose from the configuration that best suits their wants. They would also be able to chose from different hosts of the system.</p>
<p>A path forward will require the creation of new services that implement the flexibility of the old web, with the ease of use of modern social networking services.</p>

		<p>Some notes on the presidential election</p>
<h2>The GOP Debate</h2>
<p>&#42; Trump bragged about the size of his penis on the debate stage. He is keeping up the crude and vulgar thing pretty well.  And then he made a second &#8220;little Marco&#8221; joke. Two dick jokes during the evening o_O<br />
&#42; LOL at the Trump university shouting match.<br />
&#42; Cruz &#8220;Is this the debate you want on the national stage?&#8221;<br />
&#42; Kasich is sounding professional, but is for some reason crashing and burning in the actual elections.<br />
&#42; Cruz was raging about how &#8220;left rats&#8221; destroyed Detroit.<br />
&#42; Cruz &#8220;Donald has a tenuous relationship with the truth&#8221;<br />
&#42; Trump to Cruz: &#8220;Liar Ted&#8221;<br />
Cruz: Breathe. I know it&#8217;s hard, but breathe.<br />
Rubio: When you&#8217;re done with yoga, can I say something?<br />
&#42; Rubio: &#8220;Donald has not shown a seriousness on the issues of foreign policy&#8221;<br />
&#42; Trump really doesn&#8217;t seem to like his Putin sympathy pointed out.<br />
&#42; Rubio: &#8220;When will trump ever give a serious answer on foreign policy?&#8221; I&#8217;m thinking never.<br />
&#42; Russia seems to be the only country Trump wants to work with.<br />
&#42; LOL at the Kasich anti-Trump ad.<br />
&#42; It doesn&#8217;t seem like any of the candidates are ‪#‎NeverTrump‬</p>
<h2>Linky Link</h2>
<p>A good diagram from fivethirtyeight<br />
<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/live-blog/fox-news-republican-debate-detroit-presidential-election-2016/">&#8220;Tonight was a debate on the merits of Trump: questions about his character and his associated scandals made up more than a quarter of all questions asked by the moderators. His signature issue, immigration (six questions), came just behind foreign policy (eight questions).&#8221;</a><br />

<p><a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/hillary-clintons-got-this/">&#8220;Something truly crazy would have to happen for Bernie Sanders to win the Democratic nomination.&#8221;</a></p>

That would become very uncomfortable, to say the least&#8230;&#8230;.So I hope that the Sanders campaign doesn’t just brush off this criticism as the “establishment” doing its corrupt thing, and realizes that it really is in danger of losing not just an election but an important part of what it should be standing for.&#8221;</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.themoneyillusion.com/?p=31516">&#8220;Here’s what I don’t get. People can clearly see what other people are like, when they are average people. But when they are celebrities, it seems like people are unable to perceive even the most obvious character traits. I recently banned my first commenter in 7 years, a crude and obnoxious guy named &#8216;Shmebulock, Crusher of Pussy&#8217;. Almost all my other commenters, even Trump supporters, were glad to get rid of him. So why can’t they see that Trump: Crusher of Pussy, is also a juvenile troll? &#8220;</a></p>

&#42; A protectionist who wants to unroll the benefits that trade and globalization have brought the world<br />
&#42; The product of an economically illiterate working class rage.<br />
&#42; An opponent of freedom of speech<br />
&#42; An opponent of freedom of religion<br />
&#42; The coming to roost of a politics, that on both the right and the left, has made civil liberties and freedom of speech the enemy.<br />
&#42; The product of those on both the right and the left, have weakened norms in favor of civil political discourse, in order to gain short term political advantage.<br />
&#42; The product of a toxic internet social media discourse which has elevated extremism to prominence.<br />
&#42; The product of a politics which on both the right and the left has forgotten that your enemies get to use any changes to political norms that you create, as they made political discourse more toxic.<br />
&#42; The reckoning of a feedback produced by thew most toxic elements of American politics debasing core parts of political civility.<br />
&#42; The product of movements, on both the right, and the left that have sought to destroy the possibility for political and social pluralism.<br />
&#42; Evidence that the core structure that has held the U.S political world together is starting to creak. There are effectively four major political movements in the U.S; liberals [in the international sense of the word, not the American definition] (mostly Clinton), the left (Sanders), conservatives (not-Trump GOP), and the right (Trump). The political agreements that have allowed stable coalitions between those groups are pretty rapidly falling apart, and irreconcilable differences are starting to pop up. Even though a two party system is pretty vastly favored by the U.S electoral system; I have a hard time seeing how it can remain stable. At least without a very massive realignment in what the parties believe.<br />
&#42; The reckoning of a form of activism, on both sides of the political divide, conducted with the explicit goal of eliminating the possibility of ideologically neutral spaces. One with the goal to force every part of society to take an explicit stance in the culture war to the exclusion of other possible ideologies. And its a very toxic turn. It eliminates the possibility of meaningful pluralism on cultural issues. It eliminates the existence of public squares that people of different ideologies can get together in. It turns all of politics into an us versus them, out-group versus in-group battle. It damages values that are core to the proper functioning of democracy, including freedom of speech. It encourages the vilification of political enemies.<br />
&#42; The worst thing to happen to American politics in a lifetime<br />
&#42; The candidate you should never vote for under any circumstances.</p>

		<h2 class="entry-title"><a href="https://microblog.theojones.name/2016/02/28/how-i-configured-this-website/" rel="bookmark">How I configured this website</a></h2>	</header><!-- .entry-header -->

	
	
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>This post details how I set up this website and its server. This is in part for my reference. For my setup I went with Freebsd. Because of issues I&#8217;ve had with CMSes in the past, I&#8217;m going with a static site based install with no PHP or Mysql. The http server is Apache, and SSL is present, and configured with HTTP Strict Transport Security, and plain http redirects to HTTPS. I want a setup that is pretty minimalistic and secure. I am running an email server, with spam filtering outsourced to a hosted spam filtering service. My VPS host is buy VM.</p>
<h2>Freebsd install</h2>
<p>The FreeBSD install is pretty simple. A few notes here.<br />
&#42; uncheck &#8220;games&#8221; on the &#8220;distribution select&#8221; screen. These are not useful in<br />
&#42; Begin guided partitioning partitioning mode.<br />
&#42; Select entire disk and confirm that you want to erase the whole hard drive<br />
&#42; check the allocation it came up with and commit<br />
&#42; set password. A secure, long password is particularly important here, because the is a remotely accessible system. A large number of the pw3d boxen I have seen have been compromised due to a bad password.<br />
&#42; Configure the network as per your need.<br />
&#42; Set time as per your system<br />
&#42; Set sshd to start at boot. You need open ssh for remote administration.<br />
&#42; Enable crash dumps<br />
&#42; Set users as per your preference</p>
<h2>Initial Config</h2>
<p>Ssh into the regular account created. Use the su command to excelate privileges.</p>
<p>Update your ports. This is the very first thing you should do, because you will encounter errors if you try to install from the old ports that are included with the install by default.</p>
<p>portsnap fetch<br />
portsnap extract</p>
<p>Install the portmaster tool to assist in port upgrades.</p>
<p>cd /usr/ports/ports-mgmt/portmaster<br />
make config-recursive<br />
make install clean</p>
<p>Upgrade all ports</p>
<p>portmaster -a</p>
<p>Install OS security patches<br />
freebsd-update fetch</p>
<h2>Mosh Shell</h2>
<p>Mosh is an alternative remote access system to OpenSSH. It is more fault tolerant of intermittent connections, and has other benefits over raw OpenSSH.<br />
Install it as follows.<br />
cd /usr/ports/net/mosh<br />
make config-recursive<br />
make install clean</p>
<h2>git</h2>
<p>Git is needed for a number of tasks. It is used in a number of the ports, and is used to download config files later in the tutorial. Install it as follows<br />
cd /usr/ports/devel/git/<br />
make config-recursive<br />
make install clean</p>
<h2>Lets Encrypt: Install the Lets Encrypt Client</h2>
<p>Lets Encrypt is an utility that allows you to generate free SSL certificates. Install it as follows.<br />
cd /usr/ports/security/py-letsencrypt/<br />
make config-recursive<br />
make install clean</p>
<h2>Produce the Certificates</h2>
<p>letsencrypt certonly</p>
<p>You can enter multiple domains/subdomains in a single certificate, but this increases processing time enough that it isn&#8217;t worth it, unless you have<br />
a large number of subdomains. Ie.<br />
theojones.name,photos.theojones.name,archive.theojones.name,theodorejones.info</p>
<p>Certs are in /usr/local/etc/letsencrypt/live/</p>
<h2>Apache</h2>
<p>Install the Apache web server<br />
cd /usr/ports/www/apache24/<br />
make config-recursive<br />
make install clean</p>
<p>add the following line to /etc/rc.conf:</p>
<p>apache24_enable=&#8221;YES&#8221;</p>
<p>Start the server<br />
service apache24 start</p>
<p>create a folder for your document root<br />
mkdir /usr/local/www/apache24/data/theodorejones.info<br />
edit &#8220;/usr/local/etc/apache24/httpd.conf&#8221;</p>

<p>make config<br />
make install</p>
<p>echo courier_imap_imapd_enable=&#8221;YES&#8221; &gt;&gt; /etc/rc.conf<br />
echo courier_authdaemond_enable=&#8221;YES&#8221; &gt;&gt; /etc/rc.conf</p>
<p>/usr/local/etc/rc.d/courier-imap-imapd start<br />
/usr/local/etc/rc.d/courier-authdaemond start</p>
<h2>Daily Maintenance</h2>
<p>Run these commands on a regular basis to keep the system updated.</p>
