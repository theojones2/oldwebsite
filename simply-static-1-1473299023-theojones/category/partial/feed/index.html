				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A note on why a BIG is within the realm of affordability. Let&#8217;s say that you want to set the level of benefits given by the BIG equal to a basic cost of living + cost of health insurance that provides a full set of basic and essential health care services. How much would that be? 25% of percapita GDP (of the United States) is ~$13,000, which is approximately equal to the U.S poverty level for a single adult. The per-patient cost of Medicaid is $5,790 (indicating the cost of a basic level of health insurance) or ~10% of percapita GDP. http://kff.org/medicaid/state-indicator/medicaid-spending-per-enrollee/ http://www.webcitation.org/6iXDQ2Fz0 This means a combined cost of ~35% of GDP which is within the range of social spending in many European countries (if other social programs are replaced by the BIG). </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Both with the Brexit vote and with the effectiveness of Trump in the presidential primary, poll results have come much closer to the actual election outcome than expert forecasts. With Brexit, prediction markets were predicting only a 1/3rd chance of a brexit vote. Polls were projecting brexit and stay as neck and neck with the brexit side having a slight advantage. Brexit won. With the primary the polls were counting Trump as ahead quite consistently. Forecasters were much more skeptical about the possibility that Trump could win the primary. The issue here is that the heuristics that forecasters use to predict elections &#8212; the ones that normally give better results than just the polls &#8212; are very bad at forecasting the effectiveness of populists. The FiveThirtyEight polls-plus forecast gives strong weight to endorsements. http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-endorsement-primary/ http://www.webcitation.org/6iWtn7aIY This works for predicting voter behavior most of the time, but is terrible at dealing with populists, because populist voters don&#8217;t care about experts, as their core objection against the political establishment.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#8217;ve been seeing the &#8220;vertical farm&#8221; idea thrown around a lot recently. I plan to write something more through on the subject soon, but its a terrible idea. 1) the energy requirements are absurd if you attempt to grow staple crops, 2) the capital costs of a &#8220;vertical farm&#8221; would also be extremely high.
