This is a case where I would say that a system should be judged based on the incentives it creates for leaders. And, even though the electoral process will sometimes generate policies that are bad for marginalized people, democracy tends to still create good incentives in their regard. Because politicians need to get a majority of the vote and if they damage a group too much, than they will lose that portion of the vote. It’s not perfect, and there are some areas of policy that should still be removed from populist electoral pressures. But its pretty good.</p>

<b>“So. What are judges told to consider during sentencing?”<br />
</b></p>
<p>d00d! 31137t wikipedia screen cap chart! For the real story on how judges consider sentencing <a href="http://mimesislaw.com/fault-lines/why-do-federal-judges-send-criminals-to-prison/2913">read this</a> [1. http://www.webcitation.org/6ib0DkBUr ] article by U.S district court judge Richard Koph. Note the part where a number of the legitimate grounds for sentencing directed by Congress are contradictory in practice. And judges have to pick one.</p>
<p>Ie. this isn’t just utilitarianism’s problem, and and instead may be able to provide some clarity on this issue.</p>
<p>Imho utilitarianism leans pretty strongly towards what Koph calls the “crime control” justification for punishment)</p>
<p>Lets go a bit further in regards to what I mean by that last sentence. Utilitarianism will endorse the use of criminal penalties to reduce crime (as long as the net social cost of the penalty is less than the social cost of the crime). But it will be unlikely to endorse the use of criminal penalties as a way to bring about criminals’ just desserts.</p>
<p><b>“Retribution and Denunciation are deontological”<br />
</b></p>
<p>Yes with retribution (retribution is pretty much a core part of the “just desserts” viewpoint). No with denunciation. Setting social norms is a key part of the legal system, and insofar as it prevents crime, it is one that utilitarians will endorse.</p>
<p><b>“Reparation depends on the ability of the criminal to make amends….Utilitarian.”</b></p>
<p>Reperation is not inherently utilitarian. To the extent that a social norm that victims should be compisated by wrongdoers prevents crime, yes. To the extent that it causes people to take the full social cost of their actions into account, yes. (i.e. lawsuits and pigouvian taxation). But reparation isn’t a core goal here.</p>
<p>“<b>First, observe that the rationale for drug prohibition is utilitarian. The justice system cares little about marijuana possession in and of itself. Rather, it uses marijuana possession as a screening tool to find people who are at risk of committing more serious crimes in the future.</b>”</p>
<p>No. Most of the case for drug prohibition is: drugs=evil DARE to refuse. I seriously doubt that an utilitarian society would bad drugs. Utilitarianism tends to be preference neutral (preference utilitarianism explicitly, hed utilitarianism in practice). So, if you want to 420 blaze it, fine as long are you are not directly harming others. And the utilitarian crime prevention argument is tenuous at best (and even if true pigouvian taxation would be a better option).</p>
<p><b>“Stuff about how drug prohibition produces racist and ableist outcomes”<br />
</b></p>
<p>Agreed. But the connection with utilitarianism here is …. off. The rationalist community tends to be strongly in favor of utilitarianism, but is hardly chock full of tough on crime types who want to GET THE TRASH OFF THE STREETS. In fact the tough on crime mindset tends to be associated both with hardline conservatives (GET GANGS OFF THE STREETS!!!) and the hard left (DO WHAT IT TAKES TO END RAPE!!!). Both not utilitarian liberals. There is a reason. Crime forces a tradeoff between the rights of suspects and the rights of victims. Deontological ethics has a very hard time with such tradeoffs.</p>
<p>“<b>If the justice system wants to cost-effectively Minority Report future criminals, it should target the disenfranchised for arrest, and it should sentence them more harshly as well.</b>”</p>
<p>I doubt this. The wealthy guy in that case is 1) acting outside of social norms and therefore more dangerous, 2) possibly more able to be affected by incentives, and 3) less likely to be affected by community wide reforms and anti-poverty measures.</p>
<p>“<b>There’s something to be said for this argument, even though it is antithetical to justice. I do not claim that utilitarianism is worthless. My point is that it comes at a price.</b>”</p>
<p>Nah. That was just a quote from a judge trying to defend a shitty ruling, that had minimal basis in either law or ethics.</p>
