		<p>Of note, I think one big thing that Scott misses in that essay (although he comes close with the shoe example) is that conscious power is politically costly to use. A self-interested politician will only use it when the costs of it are outweighed by the benefits. Using force to suppress critics looks really bad.   Snowden’s problem was not just messing with someone powerful, but doing so in a way that was so costly to them that it was beneficial to try to take action against him. The reason internet activists don’t have to fear bad things happening to them might not just be because those in power can’t take action. It might because the activists are so weak that those in power have no reason to incur the costs of taking action. </p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Claims that the gender pay gap goes away after adjustment for variables (ie. working hours) can be dubious for a few reasons, 1) many of these variables can be outcome variables. In a world where the demand curve for labor is shifted due to discrimination, output (eg. working hours) may also directly decline, just using the adjustment tells us little about why the hours worked are lower, 2) some of the adjustment reports (particularly non-peer reviewed ones) have very large numbers of variables involved, you could get quite a bit of correlation between these variables just by random fluctuations in the data, 3) there can be broader social effects involved (although these issues don&#8217;t make the problems with using the 70% number as an indicator go away, either way you need a model of <em>why</em> these effects happen). </p>

This is a case where I would say that a system should be judged based on the incentives it creates for leaders. And, even though the electoral process will sometimes generate policies that are bad for marginalized people, democracy tends to still create good incentives in their regard. Because politicians need to get a majority of the vote and if they damage a group too much, than they will lose that portion of the vote. It’s not perfect, and there are some areas of policy that should still be removed from populist electoral pressures. But its pretty good.</p>

<p>The work of Ostrom and such does imply that communal management can be stable, avoiding both private property and the state. But this type of communal management scales poorly, and only works under certain conditions. So, for large scale issues, your options are more limited. Gardin’s choice of a commons as his reference point was perhaps a very bad focal point for his argument. Because prisoners’ dilemma type situations do happen, but oddly enough a lot of real-life common pastures, do avoid them.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>A note on why a BIG is within the realm of affordability. Let&#8217;s say that you want to set the level of benefits given by the BIG equal to a basic cost of living + cost of health insurance that provides a full set of basic and essential health care services. How much would that be? 25% of percapita GDP (of the United States) is ~$13,000, which is approximately equal to the U.S poverty level for a single adult. The per-patient cost of Medicaid is $5,790 (indicating the cost of a basic level of health insurance) or ~10% of percapita GDP. http://kff.org/medicaid/state-indicator/medicaid-spending-per-enrollee/ http://www.webcitation.org/6iXDQ2Fz0 This means a combined cost of ~35% of GDP which is within the range of social spending in many European countries (if other social programs are replaced by the BIG). </p>

In what is known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_curse">resource curse</a>, economies with many natural resources &#8212; particularly ones that can be easily extracted like oil and minerals &#8212; tend to have sluggish economic performance. This is because the resource can be easily captured by corrupt officials, damaging both the economic and the political performance of the country, as the wealth contained in the resource is diverted to the personal coffers of the officials who captured it. Very few workers are needed to manage the resource and they have little bargaining power. Waldman predicts that a similar dynamic will happen with automation. Automation will create a form of capital that is very core to how the economy functions, requires very little labor to tend, and which can be easily captured. This will damage the overall political system. According to him, it will concentrate power in the hands of the people who own this capital.</p>
<p>However, I am not fully on board with this analysis. I have a few objections 1) the resource curse dynamic is really a phenomenon of authoritarian states, and democracies have largely avoided it, 2) the evidence shows that the dictatorship came before the cursed resource ie. a cursed resource can give a dictator political strength, but is unlikely to rapidly distort the political system of an established democracy, 3) the type of automation capital at question here is fundamentally different from natural resources in its ability to generate economic rents of the relevant kind, and 4) the type of dysfunctional political system common to resource curse economies is mutually contradictory with the requirements of advanced industrial production of the type that could produce an automation curse.</p>
<p>One of the favorite things I&#8217;ve read recently is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selectorate_theory">selectorate model of politics</a>, developed by Mesquita et. al. in their academic book <em>The Logic of Political Survival</em> and in their popular book <em>The Dictator&#8217;s Handbook</em>. In this model, there is a tension between a politician&#8217;s choice to provide broad-based services that benefit most of the population, and private goods that benefit the supporters of the politician. The same money can&#8217;t be used for both. Rulers in both dictatorships and democracies need to get support from others. The main difference in political systems is the number of people in the winning coalition of supporters that the politician needs to remain in power [2. It is worth noting that Mesquita et. al do not mean &#8220;coalition&#8221; in the sense of parliamentary collation but instead means the set of supporters that the politician needs to win over. In a democracy, this can come close to the set of voters needed to win an election, although factors such as affinity voting can attenuate this] . The cost of providing private goods scales with the number of people in the winning coalition and the cost of providing public goods scales with the size of the total population of the country. This means large coalition governments (ie. well-functioning democracies) are much more likely to spend on public goods than small collation governments (ie. dictatorships). As Mesquita et. al. note [3. See page 89 of The Dictator&#8217;s Handbook], this has a direct role in explaining the resource curse. The types of resources behind the resource curse provide an efficient source of steady revenue for the dictator. When a dictatorship has a cursed resource in its country this revenue can be diverted for private goods adding strength to the dictator&#8217;s government. But a democracy will tend to use its resources to fund widely beneficial goods. This means that, based on a theoretical perspective, one would expect democracies to be a lot less prone to resource curse dynamics.</p>
<p>When the level of political freedom of the country is taken into account the resource curse goes away, and resources become a benefit. I wrote an R script to calculate the correlation between oil production and human development index [4. HDI was chosen instead of per capita GDP as a measure of development to account for an Equatorial Guniea type situation where you can have a resource cursed economy that has a high GDP but poor indicators in every other area.]. But, I adjusted this for the level of political freedom measured by <em>The Economist&#8217;s</em> Democracy Index, and for <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/04/02/beware-regional-scatterplots/">spatial autocorrelation</a> [5. archived link at http://www.webcitation.org/6hsYCVVZz]. There was a strong <em>positive</em> correlation between development and oil, once this was done. [6. The script is Resource.R in this repository <a href="https://github.com/theojones2/shiny-palm-tree">https://github.com/theojones2/shiny-palm-tree</a> and the data are also in the repository.] Code and results embedded at the end of the post.</p>
<p>And the possibility that cursed resources cause the formation of dictatorships is also lacking in evidence <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2008/07/the-perplexing.html">as noted by Mark Thoma</a> [7. The archived link at http://www.webcitation.org/6hsYljSbW ]. While institutions are not improved by oil wealth, they are not harmed either.</p>
<p>Additionally, the resource curse is closely tied to the possibility of economic rents produced from oil. Wealth from oil is effectively free, as long as you have the oil on your land. Dysfunctional institutions don&#8217;t really harm oil production. The same can not be said of the type of manufacturing at question in Waldman&#8217;s article. The production of that type can not go on if institutions are bad. Government policy can destroy the manufacturing base.</p>

<p>Robert H. Frank&#8217;s other book <em>The Darwin Economy</em> had one of the better explanations that I&#8217;ve seen for why worker protection regulations like overtime laws are needed. There are positional externalities involved in working hours. Status both within your field of work and in society as a whole are based on how you are doing relative to others. By working extreme hours you can look better than your co-workers, this creates a dynamic that affects others. Its like doping in a sport. If you dope, you can gain enough of an advantage to force everyone else to dope. But if it were possible to stop everyone from dopeing than it would benefit almost everyone.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Scott Alexander recently did an article on <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/05/23/three-great-articles-on-poverty-and-why-i-disagree-with-all-of-them/">poverty and its causes</a>  [1. archived link at http://www.webcitation.org/6hmVgMK7u ].  Both in the comments for that article, and in a footnote was the claim that a large-scale expansion of welfare spending and a large-scale expansion of immigration are incompatible policies, &#8220;<em>And then there’s the whole open borders idea, which probably isn’t very compatible with basic income at all.</em>&#8221; In this post, I will discuss the relationship between welfare programs and immigration, and I will discuss how both goals might be navigated.</p>
<p>There are two types of issues that a greatly expanded welfare system interacting with greatly expanded immigration could create</p>
<ol>
<li>The welfare migration issue. You don&#8217;t want large numbers of people migrating primarily for the possibility of accessing social services.</li>
<li>The underclass issue. You don&#8217;t want an underclass of migrants that are deprived of substantial participation in the economic and or political system.</li>
</ol>
<p>These two issues create a bit of a tradeoff. You don&#8217;t welfare migration, but if you let immigrants in but cut them off, you risk creating an underclass (if the immigration levels are sufficiently large).</p>
<p>There is also the income effect issue, where, even when immigrating for good reasons immigrants may net use government services due to having lower than average incomes. However, I am not sure this is an inherent problem, even if it results in some net harm to the native born. To the extent that immigration restrictions have allowed the income of the typical American to exceed what is viable for the rest of the world, they are unjustified, and net harmful to the typical person in the world. The maintenance of this advantage is not sufficient justification for restrictions on immigration in my opinion. However, such issues do provide practical political issues for those wanting to reduce immigration restrictions.</p>
<p>The studies I will discuss show enough of an effect of benefits on migration to be significant, but one that is sufficiently small as to not be catastrophic. I believe that the optimal way of navigating these tradeoffs are to phase in benefits based on time spent by the immigrant in the country, while still dramatically increasing the number of immigrants allowed into the country. This can be done even when the level of benefits provided is increasing or even when a BIG is enacted.</p>
<p><strong>How Big a Deal is Welfare Migration </strong></p>
<p>In order to find out to what extent immigrants could be driven to migrate for increased benefit access, it is useful to look at what happens within countries, and within free-migration zones like the European Union. Current cross-country migration to countries like the U.S is less relevant for this because the process of admission of immigrants is in part designed to filter out such people.</p>
<p>De Giorgi et. al. in their 2009 paper <em> <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537109000062">Welfare migration in Europe</a></em> [2. De Giorgi, Giacomo, and Michele Pellizzari. &#8220;Welfare migration in Europe.&#8221; Labour Economics 16, no. 4 (2009): 353-363. Harvard ], published in the journal <em>Labour Economics</em>, looked into the extent to which the expansion of the European Union caused welfare migration. They found &#8220;<em>a significant but small effect of the generosity of welfare on migration decisions &#8230; large enough to distort the distribution of migration flows</em>&#8220;. They found that an increase in the typical welfare benefit could be predicted to have about 37% of the effect that a wage increase of the same relative proportion would have. De Giorgi et. al. looked at the correlation between the generosity of welfare benefits (as measured by &#8220;the ratio between income out of work – i.e. from welfare benefits – and income in work – i.e. some measure of the average wage&#8221;) and migration patterns. They controlled for the average wage and unemployment rate. They got their data on migration levels by country and time of migration from The European Community Household Panel and their data on welfare benefits from The OECD Database on Benefit Entitlements and Replacement Rates.</p>
<p>Terra McKinnish&#8217;s 2006 paper <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3177299/"><em> Welfare-induced migration at state borders: New evidence from micro-data</em></a>, published in the <em>Journal of Public Economics, </em>[3. McKinnish, Terra. &#8220;Welfare-induced migration at state borders: New evidence from micro-data.&#8221; <i>Journal of public Economics</i> 91, no. 3 (2007): 437-450.] looks at how state by state differences in welfare spending in the United States affects migration between U.S states. She found evidence of welfare migration. While the correlation that indicates welfare migration is clear and significant, there is low confidence about the estimate of the magnitude of this effect  due to the low statistical significance of the estimate of the magnitude. They estimate that every $100/year increase in AFDC benefits will &#8220;increase the welfare participation of in-migrants by 0.32 percentage points relative to native-born&#8221;. She used data from the U.S Census Bureau.</p>
<p>The 2003 paper by Kaestner et. al. <em><a href="https://core.ac.uk/download/files/153/6707936.pdf">Migration consequences of welfare reform</a></em> published in the Journal of Urban Economics [4. Kaestner, Robert, Neeraj Kaushal, and Gregg Van Ryzin. &#8220;Migration consequences of welfare reform.&#8221; Journal of Urban Economics 53, no. 3 (2003): 357-376.Harvard ] looked at the effect of the late 1990s welfare reforms on migration between U.S states. They found that the reductions in benefits were correlated with an &#8221; increase in employment-related intrastate migration, and a decrease in non-employment related migration, both within and between states.&#8221; The probability of inter-state migration was reduced by 0.4 absolute percentage points or 12 relative percentage points. They used data from the U.S Census Bureau.</p>
<p>A 2008 paper by Dahlberg et. al. published in the <em>Journal of Public Economics </em> titled &#8220;<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Karin_Edmark2/publication/222576687_Is_there_a_race-to-the-bottom_in_the_setting_of_welfare_benefit_levels_Evidence_from_a_policy_intervention._J_Public_Econ_92(5-6)1193-1209/links/0046352452b41b8e43000000.pdf"><em>Is There a &#8216;Race-to-the-Bottom&#8217; in the Setting of Welfare Benefit Levels? Evidence from a Policy Intervention</em></a>&#8221; [5.  Dahlberg, Matz, and Karin Edmark. &#8220;Is there a “race-to-the-bottom” in the setting of welfare benefit levels? Evidence from a policy intervention.&#8221; <i>Journal of Public Economics</i> 92, no. 5 (2008): 1193-1209.], looks at the extent to which migration effects can produce race to the bottom effects in Swedish municipalities. They find that there is such a race to the bottom effect and that &#8220;the effect is economically as well as statistically significant; if the neighboring municipalities decrease their welfare benefit level by 100 SEK, a municipality decreases its benefit level with approximately 41 SEK&#8221;.</p>
<p>De Giorgi et. al., note that the effect of cross-nation immigration, could be presumed to be lower, because of the higher costs and cultural differences with such migration.</p>
<p>Jan Ekberg in a 1999 paper in the Journal of Population Economics titled &#8220;<a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s001480050106">Immigration and the public sector: Income effects for the native population in Sweden</a>&#8221; [6. Ekberg, Jan. &#8220;Immigration and the public sector: Income effects for the native population in Sweden.&#8221; Journal of Population Economics 12, no. 3 (1999): 411-430.Harvard ] looked into the net effects of immigration on the public treasury in Sweden. Sweden is useful for comparison here because it can show what could happen under greatly larger levels of welfare spending, without the restrictions on immigrant eligibility that occur in the U.S. They find that &#8220;there are negative income effects due to the deteriorating employment situation among the immigrants. The yearly positive or negative income effects have at most been 1–2% of the gross national product&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Ways Forward</strong></p>
<p>The benefits of increased immigration are sufficiently large and the effects of immigration effects are sufficiently small that I think it is possible to increase immigration levels by a very large level while still creating a net positive effect. I would suggest that immigrants should be completely ineligible for any benefits for a few years after arrival and that there should be a proportional phase in thereafter. Ie. 1/5 of the benefit the first year of eligibility, 2/5 during the second, and so, on. In the U.S <a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/basic-report/summary-immigrant-eligibility-restrictions-under-current-law">there are already such time limits in effect</a>[7. Archived link at http://www.webcitation.org/6hmldrnhc], where eligibility for most social programs does not occur until five years of residency in the U.S. This has helped to keep the fiscal effect of immigrants to the U.S net-positive unlike in Sweden. This type of mechanism partially resolves the underclass issue by providing some eligibility within a few years, but deters immigration for benefits, and allows positive revenue to accumulate the first few years of the immigrant presence (reducing income effects). In short, I think the welfare migration race to the bottom issues are small enough to be mitigable, and the income effect issues are both somewhat small and possible to ameliorate and such that it is dubious on normative grounds to use them as grounds to restrict migration.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Lets say that you are a drug company. Your drug for $disease has been successful, but your exclusive marketing rights and patents are about to expire. What do you do? Simple. Create a variant of it with a bit of dye or something else that is non-clinically active. Run a clinical trial on that sucker. But this time focus it on <i>women</i> (or the demographic of your choice). The trial will almost certainly be successful, because you know your drug works on the population as a whole, and women kind of have a few similarities with the human population as a whole. Now you have a drug that treats $disease in <i>women</i>. Exclusive marketing rights time.</p>
<p>This pretty much happens straight up with <a href="http://www.webcitation.org/6hZjEPzQL">so called Me-Too drugs</a> [1. now dead original link was https://www.optum.com/resources/library/metoodrugs.html archived link at http://www.webcitation.org/6hZjEPzQL and http://archive.is/I5l0i]. But the same general tactic is good for think-tanks who want to mislead people.</p>
<p>On social media I saw, the following article linked, with the following section quoted<br />
http://www.progressivepolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2015.11-Gerwin_The-Trans-Pacific-Partnership-and-Small-Business_Boosting-Exports-and-Inclusive-Growth.pdf</p>
<blockquote><p>The average women- owned exporting firm, for example, employs over five times more workers and pays an average salary almost $17,000 higher than non-exporting firms owned by women&#8230;..</p></blockquote>
<p> [2. Archived link at http://www.webcitation.org/6iWfrtBnt ]<br />
Trade improves gender equality. Sounds good.</p>
<p>At first I was wondering what causes the gender aspect here. Do cross culture differences suppress the effect of sexism? And then I realized that the article was a non-peer reviewed article from a think-tank with a strong view on trade (the Progressive Policy Institute). What do we know about ideological think tanks? Ah yes. They exist to promote their political views. If this means being misleading, then so be it. I got really skeptical when the paper had no comparison to other demographic groups (except minorities).</p>
<p>I then checked the source for that article, which was this article from the Census Bureau http://www2.census.gov/econ/sbo/07/sbo_export_report.pdf [3. Archived link at http://www.webcitation.org/6iWgU3GBH ]</p>
<p>Turns out the PPI did the drug company trick mentioned above. That number is purely an artifact of the fact that exporting firms are larger than purely domestic ones. Actually, women owned exporters are actually smaller companies than their man owned counterparts (seems to have something to do with the strong performance of veteran owned firms, as a strong majority of veterans are men).</p>
<p>In statistics this type of manipulation is pretty easy in cases where you can divide things up into arbitrary subgroups. See also the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modifiable_areal_unit_problem">modifiable areal unit problem</a> [4. Archived link at http://archive.is/LI9Nh].</p>
