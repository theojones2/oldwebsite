				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The r/SSC discussion is in pure scifi territory, as current tech isn’t to the point where someone in a basement with out the backing of a major company or a state, could do a project that complex (and the tech to eradicate mosquito-borne diseases with modified mosquitos is at least a few years away).<br />
But in re the r/badphilosophy thread, I’m amazed that there people who actually think that a technology that would save a million lives a year should be banned. If such tech did exist, then of course, it should be deployed. The benefits are so vast here and the diseases so destructive, that there isn’t really a substantial tradeoff here. And yes, if the level of tech assumed in the SSC thread did appear in real life, then civil disobedience would be perfectly moral in my opinion.<br />
To be somewhat harsh and uncharitable here, considering that much more stingy environmental tradeoffs are made in favor of human health and well-being all the time, the reason that this discussion occurs in response to malaria prevention has more than a little to do with the fact that the people who get malaria are 1) foreigners, and 2) not white. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This has been going around<br />
https://storify.com/ZJemptv/medium-com-jencoates<br />
http://archive.is/RjLtV<br />
Its a response (by Zinnia Jones) to <a href="https://medium.com/@jencoates/i-am-a-transwoman-i-am-in-the-closet-i-am-not-coming-out-4c2dd1907e42#.822bswypa">an essay written by Jennifer Coates</a> [1. Archived link at http://www.webcitation.org/6ixnBjJJD ] about her experiences as a Transwoman. There are a lot of problems with Zinnia Jones&#8217; response, but lets focus on this gem:</p>
<blockquote><p>
I don&#8217;t know if this person has considered there are emotional and, yes, financial repercussions to dysphoria she maybe can&#8217;t afford<br />
Disability-adjusted life years are a thing. They&#8217;ve been calculated for the impact and burden of depression.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a really dangerous misuse of QUALY metrics. Such metrics are a way for public health policy makers (ie. governments, insurance companies, and NGOs) to decide on how to allocate funding. They are not the only (or in many cases even the primary) metric one should use in deciding which treatments to use. If Jennifer Coates decided to transition, QUALY metrics are the type of thing that her insurance company should use to decide on if to fund the related medical treatments (and there is very strong evidence to suggest that insurance companies <em>should</em> fund such services).</p>
<p>But cost effectiveness is not the only relevant attribute here. Sideffects, and other downsides of the medical treatments (and of the transition process as a whole) are also very relevant here. And in the case of Coates probably the overriding factor in her decision. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is an interesting paper by Paul E. Griffiths in the journal <em>The Monist</em> titled &#8220;<a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/27903758">What Is Innateness?</a>&#8220;. In that article Griffiths argues that the concept of innateness as understood in many popular writings is incoherent. Namely, he argues that this concept includes all of the following concepts</p>
<ul>
<li>Species nature that reflects &#8220;<em>what it is to be an organism of that kind, with consequent associations of typicality or universality</em>.&#8221;</li>
<li>The telos/&#8221;intended outcome&#8221; of the organism ie. &#8220;<em>innate traits [that] are how the organism is meant to develop: to lack them is to be malformed</em>&#8221; Very normatively laden.</li>
<li>Developmental fixity &#8212; which is the one biologically well-defined and coherent element.</li>
</ul>
<p>He claims that the combined concept of innateness is strongly related to folk essentialism , and that &#8220;<em>folk essentialism is both false and fundamentally inconsistent with the Darwinian view of species, it should be rejected&#8230;&#8230; Because &#8216;innate&#8217; is a common term whose vernacular meaning embodies this way of thinking about living systems, attempts to stipulate a new, restricted meaning for this word are unlikely to be successful&#8230;. Therefore, I suggest, the use of new, neutral terms for each of these several properties is preferable to trying to retain the term &#8216;innate&#8217; for one or more of them</em>&#8220;.</p>
<p>I think this dynamic of folk essentialism has a lot to do with a number of political issues that involve scientific concepts.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The GMO issue is often treated, even by those who accept the <a href="http://www.skepticalraptor.com/skepticalraptorblog.php/the-solid-gmo-scientific-consensus/">consensus viewpoint that GMOs are safe</a> [1. Archived link at http://www.webcitation.org/6iXTgCDhA ], as a relatively trivial issue when compared to other science issues like climate change. However, the benefits of GMOs are very large, and the cost of the anti-GMO movement&#8217;s ability to damage the deployment of these technologies is great. Current technology has proven the ability to increase crop yields by over 20 percent, meaning that removing GMO crops from the market will have a similar effect on food production as a 3C increase in global temperatures. Genetic modification also has the ability to reduce other forms of environmental damage, such as land use changes. Its time to treat this as a serious issue. </p>
<p>In a 2014 study published in the journal <em>PLoS One</em> titled &#8220;A meta-analysis of the impacts of genetically modified crops.&#8221;, <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0111629">Klümper et. al found that</a> [2. Klümper, Wilhelm, and Matin Qaim. &#8220;A meta-analysis of the impacts of genetically modified crops.&#8221; PLoS One 9, no. 11 (2014): e111629. Harvard] &#8220;GM technology adoption has reduced chemical pesticide use by 37%, increased crop yields by 22%, and increased farmer profits by 68%&#8221;. This study was a meta-analysis that brought together data from 147 other studies on the subject. Higher quality, peer-reviewed studies tended to come to the conclusion of higher yield increases, than non-peer reviewed studies. The studies that estimated the lowest yield increases tended to originate from think-tanks, NGOs and &#8220;outspoken biotechnology critics&#8221;. The 22% crop yield increase number includes both the peer-reviewed, and non-peer reviewed studies. Including only the peer reviewed studies results in a yield increase estimate of 25.5 percent. Among these studies Klümper et. al. did not find a significant correlation between funding source and predicted yield increase.  They looked for evidence of publication bias using the funnel-plot method. They found no evidence of publication bias towards higher yields among journals, however, &#8220;The mean values shown in these funnel plots suggest somewhat stronger effects of GM crops,implying that the main results are rather conservative estimates.&#8221;. Ie. to the extent that there is any evidence of publication bias it serves to make GMO yields look <em>worse</em> than they should. However, Klümper et. al maintain that results regarding publication bias are highly tentative. </p>
<p>As an example of the studies aggregated by Klümper et. al take <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/299/5608/900.full.pdf+html">Qaim et. al&#8217;s</a> 2008 paper published in <em>Science</em> &#8220;Yield effects of genetically modified crops in developing countries.&#8221;. [3. Qaim, Matin, and David Zilberman. &#8220;Yield effects of genetically modified crops in developing countries.&#8221; Science 299, no. 5608 (2003): 900-902.] This study found that the insect resistant BT variety of cotton produced 1501 kilograms of cotton per hectare (Sd=857), while the unmodified cotton yielded 833 kg/hectare (Sd=572). The correlation between yield and type of cotton is significant to the 5% significance level. The effect of the plant type depended on location (due to variation in the local insect population). The strongest effects were found in sub-Saharan Africa. </p>
<p>For comparison, lets look at the estimated effect that climate change has on crop yields. <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/106/37/15594.full.pdf">Schlenker et. al in a 2009 paper</a> in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em> [4. Schlenker, Wolfram, and Michael J. Roberts. &#8220;Nonlinear temperature effects indicate severe damages to US crop yields under climate change.&#8221; Proceedings of the National Academy of sciences 106, no. 37 (2009): 15594-15598. Harvard] found yield effects of 30-46% under the IPCC B1 model, which has peak warming of approximately 3C (The more severe A1FI model results in even higher crop losses). However, Schlenker et. al. make pessimistic assumptions, and assume crops will not be moved in response to temperature changes. A follow up letter made in the same journal by Meerburg et. al note these issues. [5. Meerburg, B. G., A. Verhagen, R. E. E. Jongschaap, A. C. Franke, B. F. Schaap, T. A. Dueck, and A. van der Werf. &#8220;Do nonlinear temperature effects indicate severe damages to US crop yields under climate change?.&#8221; Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 106, no. 43 (2009): E120.] Meerburg et. al also note that genetic modification technologies have strong potential to aleviate and possibily eliminate many of the issues that cause reduced crop yields.</p>
<p>This data indicates that the use of GMO crops increases yields by between 22%-and 25%. This is similar in magnitude to the impact of 3C climate change on crop yields, and thus can be treated as a very important shift in crop yields. The use of GMO crops also has a strong role to play in climate change adaptation, and limiting the development of these crops has the potential to greatly worsen the damage caused by climate change. Additionally, the increase in crop yields has the potential to reduce the amount of land that needs to be diverted to agricultural use, and has the potential to <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/327/5967/812">greatly improve global food security</a> [6. Godfray, H. Charles J., John R. Beddington, Ian R. Crute, Lawrence Haddad, David Lawrence, James F. Muir, Jules Pretty, Sherman Robinson, Sandy M. Thomas, and Camilla Toulmin. &#8220;Food security: the challenge of feeding 9 billion people.&#8221; science 327, no. 5967 (2010): 812-818.] and reduce global poverty. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lets say that you are a drug company. Your drug for $disease has been successful, but your exclusive marketing rights and patents are about to expire. What do you do? Simple. Create a variant of it with a bit of dye or something else that is non-clinically active. Run a clinical trial on that sucker. But this time focus it on <i>women</i> (or the demographic of your choice). The trial will almost certainly be successful, because you know your drug works on the population as a whole, and women kind of have a few similarities with the human population as a whole. Now you have a drug that treats $disease in <i>women</i>. Exclusive marketing rights time.</p>
<p>This pretty much happens straight up with <a href="http://www.webcitation.org/6hZjEPzQL">so called Me-Too drugs</a> [1. now dead original link was https://www.optum.com/resources/library/metoodrugs.html archived link at http://www.webcitation.org/6hZjEPzQL and http://archive.is/I5l0i]. But the same general tactic is good for think-tanks who want to mislead people.</p>
<p>On social media I saw, the following article linked, with the following section quoted<br />
http://www.progressivepolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2015.11-Gerwin_The-Trans-Pacific-Partnership-and-Small-Business_Boosting-Exports-and-Inclusive-Growth.pdf</p>
<blockquote><p>The average women- owned exporting firm, for example, employs over five times more workers and pays an average salary almost $17,000 higher than non-exporting firms owned by women&#8230;..</p></blockquote>
<p> [2. Archived link at http://www.webcitation.org/6iWfrtBnt ]<br />
Trade improves gender equality. Sounds good.</p>
<p>At first I was wondering what causes the gender aspect here. Do cross culture differences suppress the effect of sexism? And then I realized that the article was a non-peer reviewed article from a think-tank with a strong view on trade (the Progressive Policy Institute). What do we know about ideological think tanks? Ah yes. They exist to promote their political views. If this means being misleading, then so be it. I got really skeptical when the paper had no comparison to other demographic groups (except minorities).</p>
<p>I then checked the source for that article, which was this article from the Census Bureau http://www2.census.gov/econ/sbo/07/sbo_export_report.pdf [3. Archived link at http://www.webcitation.org/6iWgU3GBH ]</p>
<p>Turns out the PPI did the drug company trick mentioned above. That number is purely an artifact of the fact that exporting firms are larger than purely domestic ones. Actually, women owned exporters are actually smaller companies than their man owned counterparts (seems to have something to do with the strong performance of veteran owned firms, as a strong majority of veterans are men).</p>
<p>In statistics this type of manipulation is pretty easy in cases where you can divide things up into arbitrary subgroups. See also the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modifiable_areal_unit_problem">modifiable areal unit problem</a> [4. Archived link at http://archive.is/LI9Nh].</p>
