<li>Ideological insults that just serve as a pejorative of the other side. The ones of this form mentioned in the link include “bankster” and “feminazi”. Other additions that I would suggest would include terms like SJW, and cuck. Variations of the name of an individual or group also apply here (Obummer, Drumpf)</li>
<li>Cites a well-known crank source, or crank. This includes sites like WattsUp, NaturalNews, and InfoWars.</li>
<li>Engages in &#8220;nutpicking&#8221; ie. taking an extreme totally fringe viewpoint and taking it as if it is a mainstream representative of a viewpoint.</li>
<li>Conspiracy theories of various kinds.</li>
<li>Calling people shills.</li>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The Gawker Media lawsuit involving a leaked sex tape of Hulk Hogan brings up some interesting issues relating to freedom of the press, particularly after the involvement of billionaire Silicon Valley entrepreneur Peter Thiel in spending 10 million dollars to fund the lawsuit came to light. Valleywag, a gossip publication owned by Gawker Media, outed Thiel, and Thiel wanted to find a plaintiff who has grounds to litigate against the publication. Richard Waters at the Financial Times covers this case <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/3ecb9de6-23b6-11e6-aa98-db1e01fabc0c.html">here</a>  [1. The article is paywalled and titled &#8220;Gawker fight pits Silicon Valley against the media&#8221; in the online edition and &#8220;Gawker lawsuit puts media on the ropes&#8221; published in the May 28, 2016, edition of the paper&#8217;s Kindle edition (I have a copy of the kindle edition)]. Scott Greenfield at Simple Justice has written a number of essays critical of the verdict, most recently, <a href="http://blog.simplejustice.us/2016/05/26/peter-thiel-hero-of-the-big-lie/">this one</a> [2. An archived version is at http://www.webcitation.org/6htnboS9w]. <a href="http://www.pragcap.com/three-things-i-think-i-think-weekend-edition-7/">Cullen Roche deals with the case here</a> [3. An archived link is here http://www.webcitation.org/6htnnhtKj].  The case is pending appeal, but Gawker Media lost 140 million dollars in a jury verdict &#8212; enough to force the company into bankruptcy. Gawker Media owns a number of large websites, including, celebrity gossip blog Gawker, advice blog Lifehacker, feminist blog Jezebel, gaming blog Kotaku, and automotive blog Jalopnik [4. Probably, if Gawker Media does go bankrupt, some of its better sites will return/persist under new ownership.]. I am of two minds on this case. On one side Gawker&#8217;s content is pure garbage, and the publication has a business model of publishing content as scandalous as possible and in skirting the lines of ethics and legality in doing so. It very well may have crossed the line in the Hulk Hogan case. However, particularly when the involvement of Thiel is included, the case provides a mechanism by which public figures can destroy a publication that prints stories which are critical of them. It should be very hard for someone of public prominence to win litigation versus journalists &#8212; even tabloid ones. Additionally, this issue tends to be magnetic to hypocrites of many types. Free speech advocates who in most cases would defend Gawker, but who are clearly motivated by disdain for the publication&#8217;s political views and clearly protected speech in their interpretation of this case [5. Thiel, who has strongly libertarian political views may be the archetype here.] are common. And then there are people who agree with the publication&#8217;s opinions in other areas, but who are defending in in strong contrast to how they handle other issues. [6. Gawker Media itself may be of note here, considering how hostile the publication is to the ideas of free speech and open discourse&#8211; when the opinions in regard are ones it disagrees with]</p>
<p><strong>Legal Background</strong> </p>
<p>A lot of the popular coverage of the Gawker Media case focus on privacy rights. But for the most part, those were secondary to the actual litigation. The courts have been very hesitant to establish privacy as a free standing exemption to free speech. In practice, most of the Gawker litigation was over 1) publicity rights , and 2) the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress. Publicity rights are a type of intellectual property right that allow an individual to control how his likeness is used in the media. They are similar to trademarks. Out of the two possible justifications, the publicity rights ones is probably the strongest of the two. And as to the large damage awards, remember, Hogan is a celebrity with a large economic value contained in his brand + punitive damages. Gawker was rather open in flaunting Hogan&#8217;s privacy in this case, and pretty clearly didn&#8217;t give a shit about the law. To make matters worse about a month after the Hogan case Gawker published editorials condemning other celebrity nude leaks &#8212; meaning they outright knew their actions were legally dubious and unethical. That&#8217;s not endearing to a judge and jury &#8212; and willful intent to harm gets penalized more than negligence. And damages are counted in large part on the economic damage caused. Hogan has a marketable brand in his name, and this was damaged by the leak of the sex tape. The damages are in part to make up for that. It looks like 1/3rd of the damages were for the direct economic damage to him, and the rest were punitive. </p>
<p><strong>The Thiel Intervention </strong><br />
Theil&#8217;s intervention in this case doesn&#8217;t worry me too much, although the idea could be taken in some negative ways by others. <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/435937/peter-thiels-crusade-against-gawker-threat-free-speech">As David French notes</a> [7. Archived link at http://www.webcitation.org/6hu1ZeE6M], what Thiel did wasn&#8217;t too different from what many activist groups do on a regular basis. Thiel wanted a legal environment that was more hostile to the type of clickbait emitted by Gawker. He found a test case that could advance this goal and funded it. One could question if his goal was the right one in this case, but that is for the courts and the political process to decide. </p>
<p>However, Thiel&#8217;s intervention in the case came pretty close to the boundary of acceptability, and may cause others to act in ways that truly cross the boundary due to the visibility of this case. You could imagine a world in which he was more aggressive in finding cases (ie. if he combed through all of Gawker Media&#8217;s activities and solicited the possibility of litigation with everyone who may have a grievance with Gawker. Or you could imagine a world in which the quality of the litigation was much lower. Thiel didn&#8217;t cross this line, but I expect others to in the near future. </p>
<p><strong>Here is the side of me that is against Gawker</strong></p>
<p>Gawker Media&#8217;s coverage on most issues tends to be one of these<br />
<iframe src="//giphy.com/embed/26FPy3QZQqGtDcrja" width="480" height="320" frameborder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p><a href="http://giphy.com/gifs/fire-dumpster-26FPy3QZQqGtDcrja">via GIPHY</a></p>
<p>Gawker Media sites have been toxic little outfits that regularly take a dump on peoples&#8217; privacy, and emit nasty outrage peddling on the media landscape. Its political publications have probably damaged the landscape of political discourse quite a bit. They very well may have finally taken things too far into the world of illegality, and now are paying the price. On the other hand, Gawker may have been 1) infringing on copyrights, publicity rights, and other areas outside of the zone of protected speech, 2) not really furthering the public debate on government policy or anything else that comes under a justification for its actions. This means that a lot of the usual justifications for strong freedom of the press go out of the window. Gawker was hardly publishing the Pentagon Papers, and may have (if the trial court ruling is upheld) doing an activity that is actually illegal. </p>
<p><strong>&#8230;.But</strong><br />
It is clear that a lot of Gawker Media&#8217;s stuff crossed the line of social acceptability. But whether it crossed the legal line, and whether the verdict aginst Gawker will be upheld is uncertain.  You can imagine cases where similar material can be perfectly news-worthy (ie. Anthony Weiner). You don&#8217;t want a legal system that discourages that type of coverage. It may be useful to distinguish between those in the public spotlight and private figures with little news worthiness. Criticisms of those in the public spotlight are very valuable even if trashy at times. And it should be very hard to litigate aginst even the trashiest of content in such debates, so as to avoid creating a chilling effect on all of discourse. It is also worrisome to see that the Gawker Media controversy has brought out some dangerous ideas regarding free-speech. The freedom of speech is not freedom from consequences people (particularly when the consequences here are state-enforced), and the people who dismiss the free speech implications altogether (ie. the one liners I&#8217;ve seen on FB like &#8220;freedom of speech means that the best you can say for your action are that they aren&#8217;t actually illegal&#8221;, and &#8220;defending Gawker in this case is like using freedom of religion to defend Kim Davis&#8221; [8. This one-liner reminds me of this  http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/07/22/freedom-on-the-centralized-web/ http://www.webcitation.org/6hu2ICg8S <i>&#8220;It would be paranoid to say that there are people for whom fighting against free speech is a terminal value, but let me make a slightly weaker claim. There are people who consider themselves the protectors of decency, who notice that their opponents are usually using the value &#8216;free speech&#8217; to oppose their demands, and so &#8216;free speech&#8217; to these people becomes the equivalent of &#8216;small government&#8217; or “tolerance and equality” or “family values” – a value which most people agree is good, but which has gotten claimed by one side of a political argument so hard that for the other side it becomes an outgroup signal and sign of cringeworthy bad arguments which must be shot down. These people don’t quite have fighting free speech as a terminal value, but you might as well model them as if they do. These are the people who say &#8216;freeze peach&#8217; in the same way other people say &#8216;but mah jawbs!&#8217;</i>&#8220;]). Such sentiments are very dangerous to the future of political discourse. </p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve seen a lot of people on social media talk about how Trump might be good in the long run because he could shake things up and force everyone else to make shifts in the toxic environment of U.S politics. Trump could shake up things in U.S politics. He very well could. But I&#8217;m not sure the change would be good. Sure, the parties could respond to the near-disaster his campaign is bringing and realize that personal vilification of opponents, hyperpartizanship, and anti-intellectualism are dangerous, even if they provide short-term political benefits. Or they could just respond to Trump by thinking the other side is scum even more and doubling down on the personal vilification of opponents, hyperpartizanship, and anti-intellectualism.</p>

This type of clickbait site fed the toxic elements of the left when they were attacking members of the GOP, but are having second thoughts when their Frankenstein is now biting other Democrats.

		<p>The structure of Facebook and other social media services is quite malformed if you want serious discussion about complex issues. Here is how design decisions in Facebook encourage shitposting</p>
<ul>
<li>The &#8220;like&#8221; and the &#8220;share&#8221; system (combined with the lack of a downvote mechanism) provides positive reinforcement to people who post low-quality content. There will be a few likeminded people who like the stuff you share, even if it it is disliked by almost everyone else</li>
<li>Long-form content is second-class. While FB isn&#8217;t as extreme here as Twitter, its design still makes short posts and image posts more visible. This encourages memes and one liners over actual discussion.</li>
<li>Facebook bubbles users. It gives users what they have interacted with and liked in the past and filters out all of the other posts from their feed. This is done both on a per user basis and a site-wide basis. This limits exposure to opposing views.</li>
</ul>
<p>The effects of these tendencies on the broader world of political discourse are pernicious. People are no longer using traditional media sources, and are instead relying on social media more and more.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Lets say that you are a drug company. Your drug for $disease has been successful, but your exclusive marketing rights and patents are about to expire. What do you do? Simple. Create a variant of it with a bit of dye or something else that is non-clinically active. Run a clinical trial on that sucker. But this time focus it on <i>women</i> (or the demographic of your choice). The trial will almost certainly be successful, because you know your drug works on the population as a whole, and women kind of have a few similarities with the human population as a whole. Now you have a drug that treats $disease in <i>women</i>. Exclusive marketing rights time.</p>
<p>This pretty much happens straight up with <a href="http://www.webcitation.org/6hZjEPzQL">so called Me-Too drugs</a> [1. now dead original link was https://www.optum.com/resources/library/metoodrugs.html archived link at http://www.webcitation.org/6hZjEPzQL and http://archive.is/I5l0i]. But the same general tactic is good for think-tanks who want to mislead people.</p>
<p>On social media I saw, the following article linked, with the following section quoted<br />
http://www.progressivepolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2015.11-Gerwin_The-Trans-Pacific-Partnership-and-Small-Business_Boosting-Exports-and-Inclusive-Growth.pdf</p>
<blockquote><p>The average women- owned exporting firm, for example, employs over five times more workers and pays an average salary almost $17,000 higher than non-exporting firms owned by women&#8230;..</p></blockquote>
<p> [2. Archived link at http://www.webcitation.org/6iWfrtBnt ]<br />
Trade improves gender equality. Sounds good.</p>
<p>At first I was wondering what causes the gender aspect here. Do cross culture differences suppress the effect of sexism? And then I realized that the article was a non-peer reviewed article from a think-tank with a strong view on trade (the Progressive Policy Institute). What do we know about ideological think tanks? Ah yes. They exist to promote their political views. If this means being misleading, then so be it. I got really skeptical when the paper had no comparison to other demographic groups (except minorities).</p>
<p>I then checked the source for that article, which was this article from the Census Bureau http://www2.census.gov/econ/sbo/07/sbo_export_report.pdf [3. Archived link at http://www.webcitation.org/6iWgU3GBH ]</p>
<p>Turns out the PPI did the drug company trick mentioned above. That number is purely an artifact of the fact that exporting firms are larger than purely domestic ones. Actually, women owned exporters are actually smaller companies than their man owned counterparts (seems to have something to do with the strong performance of veteran owned firms, as a strong majority of veterans are men).</p>
<p>In statistics this type of manipulation is pretty easy in cases where you can divide things up into arbitrary subgroups. See also the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modifiable_areal_unit_problem">modifiable areal unit problem</a> [4. Archived link at http://archive.is/LI9Nh].</p>

		<p>I am Clinton voting and sympathetic to the goals of the left, but, I have developed a <em><strong>strong</strong></em> dislike for the left as currently exists. There is a really nasty political culture, particularly on the campus left. </p>
<p>There are people who can&#8217;t fathom the possibility that open discourse is important or that they could be wrong on a policy issue. So, they want to shut down all discourse and deal with others through intimation. Its gotten to the point that open discourse and free speech are becoming conservative values that the left on the whole is against, at least from my vantage point. These people don&#8217;t even attempt to understand why people believe what they believe, and think that anyone who is less left wing than them is debauched evil scum, or ill-informed.<br />
And worse of all, they can&#8217;t realize that even when the values of it are put aside, this type of strategy is self-destructive because the changes they are making to the social norms that govern political discourse will be used against them eventually. They think that they can limit harassment and vilification and no-platforming and personal destruction of their political opponents to just their enemies.<br />
And as Bernie&#8217;s campaign shows this toxic culture is escaping the left-wing enclaves that are its home and leaking very quickly into the political mainstream.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I think there is a big issue in the structure of Twitter, Facebook and other social media content silos. These services try to be a jack of all trades, and wind up being a master of none.</p>
<p>There are five roles that a communication service can fulfill,</p>
<ol>
<li>1 to 1 communication between two individuals (ie. personal email)</li>
<li>one to many communication (ie. a newspaper)</li>
<li>a group of like-minded individuals coming together to discuss a matter of common interest (ie. an Internet forum for conservatives)</li>
<li>a community of people with, disparate views to come together and discuss those differences (ie. a broader focus Internet forum)</li>
<li>core infrastructure that serves a bunch of unrelated users with different interests and goals (ie. a webhost).</li>
</ol>
<p>Your typical content silo tries to be all five, and this creates a lot of problems, and tensions.</p>
<h3 id="differing-expectations-and-sealions">Differing Expectations and Sealions</h3>
<p>This creates people with different expectations of what type of community they are dealing with. There are a lot of different communities and users with different goals. And sometimes these communities don’t get along. The structure of social media systems forces them into the same silo. This creates perverse outcomes.</p>
<p>Have you heard of the concept of sealioning? It refers the the tendency of a comment made on Twitter on a controversial subject, to attract a negative response from partisans on the issue. If you make a Tweet on a controversial subject, people will try to respond to you , and this can create some hostile dynamics. The phrase originates from <a href="http://wondermark.com/1k62/">a cartoon by David Malki</a>. In the cartoon, one character insults sealions in a conversation with another character. An anthropomorphic sealion then enters the conversation, and requests that the insulter justify the comment, and follows the insulter home.</p>
<p>The phrase <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/sea-lioning">came to prominence</a> during the whole #GamerGate shitshow. But it describes a situation that has preexisted that tirefire, and which still happens on many other issues. <a href="http://inthesetimes.com/article/18850/kind-of-discourse-we-need">Take the 2016 presidential election</a>, and the discussion about it on Twitter. Support a candidate, or oppose one vocally on Twitter, and you run the chance of getting a negative response from the partisans for that candidate. The supporters of both Trump and <a href="http://www.vox.com/2016/2/4/10918710/berniebro-bernie-bro">Sanders</a> are particularly known <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/10/here-comes-the-berniebro-bernie-sanders/411070/">for their aggression on social media</a> .</p>
<p>And then there is the strongly related phenomenon of the <a href="https://medium.com/@randileeharper/solving-twitter-dogpiles-7d7b102116c8#.f1q6hlo5i">Twitter dogpile</a>. In a dog-pile, someone writes a tweet that gets a lot of attention from other tweeters. Those angry at the offending tweet then send their responses to the original tweeter. The result is a flooding of the original tweeter with angry messages.</p>
<p>The tension between the different roles of Twitter is where the sealioning, dogpiling, and related issues comes from. Twitter (and other social media platforms) is at once functioning as a public forum for public discussion, and at once as a personalized medium. And its not navigating that impasse very well.</p>
<p>Remember the original cartoon. The sealion followed the person who insulted the sealion home home. And that’s what the people who complain about sealioning think is happening. Their vision of the purpose of Twitter is one in which they are dealing with like-minded people, or broadcasting their ideas to people who agree with them. Their conception of what Twitter is marks off 1,2,and three on my roles of a communication service, but they aren’t using Twitter for roles 4 and five. They look at their notifications and, like the sealioned person in the cartoon, see someone intruding on their home. Meanwhile, the person who is responding to the Tweet, thinks of Twitter as a way for people with disagreeing viewpoints to interact, and therefore thinks it is perfectly fine to rebut the person talking about how evil sealions are.</p>
<p>Considering the structure of Twitter, both have a point. The situation is at an impasse, and the structure of the platform tries to suit all possible uses at the expense of fulfilling none of them.</p>
<h3 id="censorship">Censorship</h3>
<p>This also creates some of the controversies over censorship. Social networks are in large part acting as core infrastructure, while also serving as content and communities on top of that infrastructure.</p>
<p>There are communities, and there are protocols. Infrastructure means there must be what in a decentralized system would be a protocol for communication. Protocols tend to have a strong tendency towards natural monopolies due to network effects. A communication protocol is only useful to the extent that other people are using it. Unless there are very strong intensives the other way, you will use the most popular protocol. The market will therefore become quite concentrated and non-competitive.</p>
<p>This has happened on lower levels of Internet-based protocols. Gopher lost the competition to HTTP. And so on.</p>
<p>In the pre-social media world, there was a separation between the communities themselves and the This website is a discrete community, and the VPS I host it on implements various protocols to allow users to get access to the content. But, as long as everyone agrees on the protocol itself, there can be competition on the higher levels of the system. There can be many blogs and fora with different owners served over HTTP. There can even be competition on the infrastructure level.</p>
<p>The multiple roles of most social networks serve to combine protocol with implementation. This makes the type of diversity of different communities and implementations that dominated the pre-social web impossible. It serves to concentrate substantial power over the Internet and the discourse that happens on it into the owners of these systems.</p>
<p>And its important infrastructure. Social media sites contain so much of Internet discourse that if your opinion is blocked from them, then you are at a severe disadvantage in getting it out. They are so powerful that by taking sides on political issues they could alter the discourse on those issues quite a bit. Its safe to say that both Sanders and Trump are social media candidates– if social media wasn’t available to them, then they couldn’t sustain their campaign solely on traditional media. FiveThirtyEight has a <a href="http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/facebook-primary/">post up showing the social media mentions of each candidate for president</a> , if you want a visualization of this. Major social media websites taking sides on political issues could very quickly alter the whole political discourse of the country. Social media services and other Internet infrastructure.</p>
<p>The real problem and controversy comes from the dual roles of social media —- Twitter/Facebook/Tumblr isn’t purely infrastructure. They are also communities. The infrastructure role of these services pushes them in the direction of needing ideological diversity and tolerance for a wide range of varying viewpoints.</p>
<p>The community-like nature of these pushes them in the other direction.</p>
<p>This is in large part because the different communities can affect each other. If my webhost also hosted a neo-nazi blog, it wouldn’t affect my site very much. The neo-nazis could read their site, and my readers could read mine. But if a bunch of neo-nazis started using Twitter, then there would be clear leakage on the other users. And this could damage the reputation of Twitter. One remark that I’ve seen a few times on this issue: If a bunch of Hells Angles start attending your bar, then you become a Hells Angles bar unless you kick them out. If you are in the same tightly knit Internet community as some pretty terrible people – then those terrible people are going to affect you. Again an impasse created by the dual roles of Twitter.</p>
<h3 id="toxic-communities">Toxic communities</h3>
<p>The big social networks also tend to have some pretty nasty issues with toxic subcultures, and sub-communities. Tumblr is probably the worst in this vein. The site’s fandom and social justice sub-community wars have given the site a name in the broader Internet community.</p>
<p>And on Twitter you get toxic groups forming a collective group and becoming a menace to other users. This type of issue is definitely seen with tire-fires such as #GamerGate where you get a whole sub-community form that is a big dump of toxic on the rest of the users of the system.</p>
<p>The same leakage issue created by dual roles that I mentioned earlier applies here. When you have toxic neighbors, its hard to avoid their effects on your usage of the service.</p>
<p>But the multiple communication services roles problem creates another issue here. It becomes very difficult for the sub-communities to self-moderate. In a proper Internet forum the ban-hammer is always a option, and in well functioning communities often applied. Due to the broad,based infrastructure-like roles of the social networks, the banhammer is applied very lightly. Sub-communities can not eject their malefactors. The Bernie Sanders supporter community on Twitter can not eject the toxic berniebros that engage in crude and sexist behavior. If instead of Twitter, they were on an Internet forum dedicated towards their politics – the gentle, warm glow of the banhammer could be applied to these types. Both the reputation of the wider community and the ability for proper discourse to happen is greatly damaged.</p>
<h3 id="path-forward">Path Forward</h3>
<p>In the short run, social media services can address this issue by <a href="https://medium.com/art-marketing/putting-out-the-twitter-trashfire-3ac6cb1af3e#.8mten26a4">adding features</a> to their services that allow users to have more control over the messages they see. This control can allow users to adjust the nature of the service as used by them so that it is better suited to them. This could take the form of opt in filtering, options to adjust the user interface, options to suppress notifications, and opt-in blocklists.</p>
<p>However, this type of adjustment will not work in the long run . I think these problems are an inherent problem in the design of current social networking services, one that will eventually lead to their decline, and replacement with services that handle each type of Internet communication more individually. Solving these structural issues will 1) require returning to the decentralization of the pre-social media web, 2) replacing current social networks with general protocols, and 3) creating separate protocols for each major type of communication .</p>
<p>The reason Twitter type services gained popularity is more their ease of use, then their structure. Users want a presence on the web, one that is personalized, and that allows them to connect with others. The old, pre-social network web, had fewer of these issues. All of the major communication functions were well-separated. Discrete communities were isolated.</p>
<p>The problem here was ease of use. Getting an Internet presence outside of the use of social media services takes substantial technical skill. Skill that most users do not have. The first feature that a good social network replacement should have is ease of use.</p>
<p>Decentralization is also important. Current centralized social networking websites, such as Facebook have many flaws. They have persistent privacy issues and breaches. Their moderation policies are often problematic and applied arbitrarily. These systems are vulnerable to censorship and government manipulation. The risks of this to privacy are shown by the NSA leaks. The risks to <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2238519/Facebook-bans-picture-woman-reclining-bathtub--shows-elbow.html">free speech are shown by how, when under pressure from the Turkish government Facebook restricted posts advocating</a> Kurdish independence and “Any attack on Ataturk [Turkey’s first president]”. With a centralized structure these issues of government interference are almost unavoidable. The nature of these networks also means that there is little ability for the user to modify and customize the interface because all of the code runs on the server, and because this code is not open source. This is part of the reason why Facebook has to roll out interface changes to all users, often with many dissatisfied users. Some projects have tried to improve the Facebook interface by running client-side software that modifies the HTML and JavaScript produced by Facebook, but this method is error prone. A distributed social network built around a single protocol that allows different implementations of the system, running on different servers would fix these issues. A decentralized social network would lessen all of the issues I discussed. If individuals run their own servers, governments would have a hard time controlling these servers. A decentralized system would allow many different implementations and configurations of the system to run. The users would be allowed to choose from the configuration that best suits their wants. They would also be able to chose from different hosts of the system.</p>
<p>A path forward will require the creation of new services that implement the flexibility of the old web, with the ease of use of modern social networking services.</p>

		<p>Some notes on the presidential election</p>
<h2>The GOP Debate</h2>
<p>&#42; Trump bragged about the size of his penis on the debate stage. He is keeping up the crude and vulgar thing pretty well.  And then he made a second &#8220;little Marco&#8221; joke. Two dick jokes during the evening o_O<br />
&#42; LOL at the Trump university shouting match.<br />
&#42; Cruz &#8220;Is this the debate you want on the national stage?&#8221;<br />
&#42; Kasich is sounding professional, but is for some reason crashing and burning in the actual elections.<br />
&#42; Cruz was raging about how &#8220;left rats&#8221; destroyed Detroit.<br />
&#42; Cruz &#8220;Donald has a tenuous relationship with the truth&#8221;<br />
&#42; Trump to Cruz: &#8220;Liar Ted&#8221;<br />
Cruz: Breathe. I know it&#8217;s hard, but breathe.<br />
Rubio: When you&#8217;re done with yoga, can I say something?<br />
&#42; Rubio: &#8220;Donald has not shown a seriousness on the issues of foreign policy&#8221;<br />
&#42; Trump really doesn&#8217;t seem to like his Putin sympathy pointed out.<br />
&#42; Rubio: &#8220;When will trump ever give a serious answer on foreign policy?&#8221; I&#8217;m thinking never.<br />
&#42; Russia seems to be the only country Trump wants to work with.<br />
&#42; LOL at the Kasich anti-Trump ad.<br />
&#42; It doesn&#8217;t seem like any of the candidates are ‪#‎NeverTrump‬</p>
<h2>Linky Link</h2>
<p>A good diagram from fivethirtyeight<br />
<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/live-blog/fox-news-republican-debate-detroit-presidential-election-2016/">&#8220;Tonight was a debate on the merits of Trump: questions about his character and his associated scandals made up more than a quarter of all questions asked by the moderators. His signature issue, immigration (six questions), came just behind foreign policy (eight questions).&#8221;</a><br />
<img src="https://theojones.name/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/libresco-topics-liveblog.png" alt="libresco-topics-liveblog" width="575" height="306" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25" /></p>
<p><a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/claudiarosenbaum/caitlyn-jenner-wants-to-be-ted-cruzs-trans-ambassador#.wjaoM9ymR">&#8220;Caitlyn Jenner Wants To Be Ted Cruz’s Trans Ambassador&#8221;</a>. If it were Trump and not Cruz, then it would be South Park becoming real life.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21693933-donald-trump-and-hillary-clinton-win-seven-states-apiece-republican-and-democratic?fsrc=scn/fb/te/pe/ed/goodbyerubiotuesday">&#8220;Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton win seven states apiece. The Republican and Democratic nominations are theirs to lose&#8221;</a></p>
<p>Stormfront loves Trump. So do chan trolls, #GamerGate supporters and NRx types. <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/donald-trump-republican-race-white-power-1.3290776">&#8220;Trump gets thumbs-up from neo-Nazis, white nationalists&#8221;</a>    <a href="http://www.vocativ.com/news/239143/donald-trump-embraces-his-4chan-fans/">&#8220;Donald Trump Embraces His 4Chan Fans&#8221;</a></p>
<p><a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/hillary-clintons-got-this/">&#8220;Something truly crazy would have to happen for Bernie Sanders to win the Democratic nomination.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>Krugman on Sanders<a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/02/18/wonkery-has-a-well-known-liberal-bias/?module=BlogPost-Title&amp;version=Blog%20Main&amp;contentCollection=Opinion&amp;action=Click&amp;pgtype=Blogs&amp;region=Body">&#8220;But what if the political left starts behaving like the political right, making support for implausible claims a litmus test of loyalty, declaring that anyone raising hard questions is ipso facto corrupt? That would become very uncomfortable, to say the least&#8230;&#8230;.So I hope that the Sanders campaign doesn’t just brush off this criticism as the “establishment” doing its corrupt thing, and realizes that it really is in danger of losing not just an election but an important part of what it should be standing for.&#8221;</a></p>
<p><a href="http://time.com/4194179/bernie-sanders-tax-plan/">&#8220;Here’s How Much Bernie Sanders Would Raise Taxes. It&#8217;s a very, very, very big tax increase for everyone except those at the bottom.&#8221;</a></p>

<p>Scott Summer on Trump</p>
<p><a href="http://www.themoneyillusion.com/?p=31516">&#8220;Here’s what I don’t get. People can clearly see what other people are like, when they are average people. But when they are celebrities, it seems like people are unable to perceive even the most obvious character traits. I recently banned my first commenter in 7 years, a crude and obnoxious guy named &#8216;Shmebulock, Crusher of Pussy&#8217;. Almost all my other commenters, even Trump supporters, were glad to get rid of him. So why can’t they see that Trump: Crusher of Pussy, is also a juvenile troll? &#8220;</a></p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<h2>Trump is&#8230;..</h2>
<p>&#42; A bigot, a racist, and a sexist<br />
&#42; A person who&#8217;s political success is a reflection of how mangled political discourse has become<br />
&#42; A wakeup call to those who have ignored the growing political extremism and toxicity that has developed on both sides of aisle .<br />
&#42; The product of a political environment that has increasingly replaced the humane universal values of individual rights, personal freedom, and shared prosperity, with toxic tribalism.<br />
&#42; An opportunity for those who, on both side of the political divide, have made politics about out-group vilification and tribalism to see what they have wrought.<br />
&#42; The illustration of the most toxic parts of U.S politics<br />
&#42; An authoritarian who opposes fundamental parts of American civil liberties<br />
&#42; A nativist who seeks to deny the world the great benefits that increased immigration can bring the world.<br />
&#42; A protectionist who wants to unroll the benefits that trade and globalization have brought the world<br />
&#42; The product of an economically illiterate working class rage.<br />
&#42; An opponent of freedom of speech<br />
&#42; An opponent of freedom of religion<br />
&#42; The coming to roost of a politics, that on both the right and the left, has made civil liberties and freedom of speech the enemy.<br />
&#42; The product of those on both the right and the left, have weakened norms in favor of civil political discourse, in order to gain short term political advantage.<br />
&#42; The product of a toxic internet social media discourse which has elevated extremism to prominence.<br />
&#42; The product of a politics which on both the right and the left has forgotten that your enemies get to use any changes to political norms that you create, as they made political discourse more toxic.<br />
&#42; The reckoning of a feedback produced by thew most toxic elements of American politics debasing core parts of political civility.<br />
&#42; The product of movements, on both the right, and the left that have sought to destroy the possibility for political and social pluralism.<br />
&#42; Evidence that the core structure that has held the U.S political world together is starting to creak. There are effectively four major political movements in the U.S; liberals [in the international sense of the word, not the American definition] (mostly Clinton), the left (Sanders), conservatives (not-Trump GOP), and the right (Trump). The political agreements that have allowed stable coalitions between those groups are pretty rapidly falling apart, and irreconcilable differences are starting to pop up. Even though a two party system is pretty vastly favored by the U.S electoral system; I have a hard time seeing how it can remain stable. At least without a very massive realignment in what the parties believe.<br />
&#42; The reckoning of a form of activism, on both sides of the political divide, conducted with the explicit goal of eliminating the possibility of ideologically neutral spaces. One with the goal to force every part of society to take an explicit stance in the culture war to the exclusion of other possible ideologies. And its a very toxic turn. It eliminates the possibility of meaningful pluralism on cultural issues. It eliminates the existence of public squares that people of different ideologies can get together in. It turns all of politics into an us versus them, out-group versus in-group battle. It damages values that are core to the proper functioning of democracy, including freedom of speech. It encourages the vilification of political enemies.<br />
&#42; The worst thing to happen to American politics in a lifetime<br />
&#42; The candidate you should never vote for under any circumstances.</p>
