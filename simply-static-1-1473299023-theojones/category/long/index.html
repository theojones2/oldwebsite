	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Earlier this week in Sacramento <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/06/26/483619054/amid-violence-at-white-nationalist-rally-in-sacramento-at-least-7-hospitalized">attendees at a far-right white nationalist rally clashed with far-left counter protesters</a> [1. http://www.webcitation.org/6icS07TIB] who used force to prevent the far-right rally from being held. From the facts as described by both the previously mentioned NPR article, and by <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/26/us/brawl-at-california-rally/">CNN&#8217;s coverage of the issue</a> [2. http://www.webcitation.org/6icS7LjPq ], it sounds like the far-left counter-protesters initiated the violence and some of them went to the far-right event with the direct intent to disrupt it (as one internet posting before rally put it &#8220;by all means necessary&#8221;). Suppressing the actions of racist extremists (as long as they are not engaging in illegal activity) is probably a bad idea for various reasons. [3. an interesting discussion of these issues in the <a href="http://misanthropymademe.tumblr.com/">series of posts here</a> archived at http://archive.is/ER0oo ]  </p>
<p>Since skinheads are not known for being the most peaceful types around, one argument for suppressing such groups involves the possibility that eliminating far-right groups could reduce the number of extremists who resort to violence. In this particular case it clearly did not, but we can ask more generally. A lot of countries vary in their tolerance for such extremists, with some countries banning them outright by legal force, and others (ie. the United States keeping them legal). If you believe that banning far right groups reduces violence, than the levels of hate crimes in countries that ban hate speech should be lower than in countries where it is legal. This translates pretty directly into evaluating the effectiveness of privately coordinated attempts to suppress these groups. However, this does not seem to be the case. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights keeps track of hate crime levels both in European Union members and some countries that are not E.U members (including the United States, Canada, and Switzerland). <a href="http://hatecrime.osce.org/">This dataset</a> [4.<br />
http://www.webcitation.org/6icTfdUi0] reports absolute numbers for crimes, but combined with population data <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_population_(United_Nations)">from here</a> [5. http://www.webcitation.org/6icTr2Jmb], per capita levels of hate crimes can be compared. A quick look through of this data does not seem to indicate that banning extremest groups reduces violence. For instance <a href="http://hatecrime.osce.org/canada">Canada</a> [6. http://www.webcitation.org/6icUpkERp] has a hate crimes rate that is 1.6 times that of the <a href="http://hatecrime.osce.org/united-states-america">United States</a> [7. http://www.webcitation.org/6icUuuEg9] &#8212; despite Canada&#8217;s hate speech laws. Over all <a href="http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/stats/Crime/Assaults">rates of violent crime</a> [8. http://www.webcitation.org/6icV5WZ2r] are similar between the two countries, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate">over all rates of homicides</a> are higher in the the United States. </p>
<p>Indeed, I think there is a case to be made that suppressing far-right extremest groups from organizing could actually make them more violent. <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/lr/evaporative_cooling_of_group_beliefs/">When religious cults undergo an event that reduces</a> [8. http://archive.is/bgCxj] their membership, the most moderate members the first to leave, and the remaining members become even more extreme. This is because the relatively moderate members of the cult moderate the other members and reduce the over-all extremism level in the group. The presence of the relatively moderate members of the cult create social pressure against being too fanatical. I suppose that the same effect exists with political extremists. With political extremism, fanaticism correlates with violent tendencies. Suppressing extremist groups increases the costs of joining the group, and this will remove moderate members from the extremest group increasing violence. This means that suppressing   [9. In the interest of balance I will note that the following paper has a model that predicts that this cost increasing effect will have the opposite impact from what I predict &#8212; so my prediction should be taken with some tentativeness   Dharmapala, Dhammika, and Richard H. McAdams. &#8220;Words that kill? An economic model of the influence of speech on behavior (with particular reference to hate speech).&#8221; The Journal of Legal Studies 34, no. 1 (2005): 93-136.]  [10. The usual limits about armchair sociology apply here] Additionally, forcing extremest groups underground may make their workings less known, and thus make them harder to defeat, and it may reinforce their conspiracy view of the world.  </p>
<p>Since the above is pretty rough and cursory, I tried to find an academic analysis of the effectiveness of hate speech laws. As far as I have been able to find, there aren&#8217;t really empirical studies on the subject.  If any one reading this does know of empirical studies that look into the extent to which laws banning hate speech reduce the number of hate crimes that occur, bring them up in the comments. I&#8217;ve found theoretical research on this subject,but nothing empirical. And I found studies indicating that the presence of bigoted attitudes in the population increases the number of crimes, but not that much on laws banning the expression of these attitudes (I know that the last sentence to an extent contradicts my point, but not too much). I am open to hearing papers that contradict my views express here . </p>
<p>Other than ineffectiveness, one should be against this type of method, because it will hit other people than the far-right.  </p>
<p>This type of clash is going to leak into mainstream politics and mainstream political events are going to get targeted and its going to get ugly quickly. </p>
<p>I saw a (reasonably large center-left) blog defending the counter protesters on this issue use the “freedom of speech is just about the relation between the government and people” and the “freedom of speech isn’t freedom from consequences” one liners on this issue [11. Not linking to it, its the type of toxic rhetoric that I really don&#8217;t want to spread, and make more visible. ]. Considering that those zingers have been used in regards to no platforming mainstream ideologies, its only a matter of time before the violent variant also targets someone mainstream. Not good. I don’t want a world where political disputes are resolved through street brawls. I like it when politics happens through the ballot box, not the ammo box. </p>
<p>When this is happening to skinheads its troublesome, but not terrifying. But what will be terrifying is when some of these clowns start to think that mainstream conservatives and libertarians need to be stopped “by all means necessary”. </p>

		<p>Claims that the gender pay gap goes away after adjustment for variables (ie. working hours) can be dubious for a few reasons, 1) many of these variables can be outcome variables. In a world where the demand curve for labor is shifted due to discrimination, output (eg. working hours) may also directly decline, just using the adjustment tells us little about why the hours worked are lower, 2) some of the adjustment reports (particularly non-peer reviewed ones) have very large numbers of variables involved, you could get quite a bit of correlation between these variables just by random fluctuations in the data, 3) there can be broader social effects involved (although these issues don&#8217;t make the problems with using the 70% number as an indicator go away, either way you need a model of <em>why</em> these effects happen). </p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The GMO issue is often treated, even by those who accept the <a href="http://www.skepticalraptor.com/skepticalraptorblog.php/the-solid-gmo-scientific-consensus/">consensus viewpoint that GMOs are safe</a> [1. Archived link at http://www.webcitation.org/6iXTgCDhA ], as a relatively trivial issue when compared to other science issues like climate change. However, the benefits of GMOs are very large, and the cost of the anti-GMO movement&#8217;s ability to damage the deployment of these technologies is great. Current technology has proven the ability to increase crop yields by over 20 percent, meaning that removing GMO crops from the market will have a similar effect on food production as a 3C increase in global temperatures. Genetic modification also has the ability to reduce other forms of environmental damage, such as land use changes. Its time to treat this as a serious issue. </p>
<p>In a 2014 study published in the journal <em>PLoS One</em> titled &#8220;A meta-analysis of the impacts of genetically modified crops.&#8221;, <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0111629">Klümper et. al found that</a> [2. Klümper, Wilhelm, and Matin Qaim. &#8220;A meta-analysis of the impacts of genetically modified crops.&#8221; PLoS One 9, no. 11 (2014): e111629. Harvard] &#8220;GM technology adoption has reduced chemical pesticide use by 37%, increased crop yields by 22%, and increased farmer profits by 68%&#8221;. This study was a meta-analysis that brought together data from 147 other studies on the subject. Higher quality, peer-reviewed studies tended to come to the conclusion of higher yield increases, than non-peer reviewed studies. The studies that estimated the lowest yield increases tended to originate from think-tanks, NGOs and &#8220;outspoken biotechnology critics&#8221;. The 22% crop yield increase number includes both the peer-reviewed, and non-peer reviewed studies. Including only the peer reviewed studies results in a yield increase estimate of 25.5 percent. Among these studies Klümper et. al. did not find a significant correlation between funding source and predicted yield increase.  They looked for evidence of publication bias using the funnel-plot method. They found no evidence of publication bias towards higher yields among journals, however, &#8220;The mean values shown in these funnel plots suggest somewhat stronger effects of GM crops,implying that the main results are rather conservative estimates.&#8221;. Ie. to the extent that there is any evidence of publication bias it serves to make GMO yields look <em>worse</em> than they should. However, Klümper et. al maintain that results regarding publication bias are highly tentative. </p>
<p>As an example of the studies aggregated by Klümper et. al take <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/299/5608/900.full.pdf+html">Qaim et. al&#8217;s</a> 2008 paper published in <em>Science</em> &#8220;Yield effects of genetically modified crops in developing countries.&#8221;. [3. Qaim, Matin, and David Zilberman. &#8220;Yield effects of genetically modified crops in developing countries.&#8221; Science 299, no. 5608 (2003): 900-902.] This study found that the insect resistant BT variety of cotton produced 1501 kilograms of cotton per hectare (Sd=857), while the unmodified cotton yielded 833 kg/hectare (Sd=572). The correlation between yield and type of cotton is significant to the 5% significance level. The effect of the plant type depended on location (due to variation in the local insect population). The strongest effects were found in sub-Saharan Africa. </p>
<p>For comparison, lets look at the estimated effect that climate change has on crop yields. <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/106/37/15594.full.pdf">Schlenker et. al in a 2009 paper</a> in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em> [4. Schlenker, Wolfram, and Michael J. Roberts. &#8220;Nonlinear temperature effects indicate severe damages to US crop yields under climate change.&#8221; Proceedings of the National Academy of sciences 106, no. 37 (2009): 15594-15598. Harvard] found yield effects of 30-46% under the IPCC B1 model, which has peak warming of approximately 3C (The more severe A1FI model results in even higher crop losses). However, Schlenker et. al. make pessimistic assumptions, and assume crops will not be moved in response to temperature changes. A follow up letter made in the same journal by Meerburg et. al note these issues. [5. Meerburg, B. G., A. Verhagen, R. E. E. Jongschaap, A. C. Franke, B. F. Schaap, T. A. Dueck, and A. van der Werf. &#8220;Do nonlinear temperature effects indicate severe damages to US crop yields under climate change?.&#8221; Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 106, no. 43 (2009): E120.] Meerburg et. al also note that genetic modification technologies have strong potential to aleviate and possibily eliminate many of the issues that cause reduced crop yields.</p>
<p>This data indicates that the use of GMO crops increases yields by between 22%-and 25%. This is similar in magnitude to the impact of 3C climate change on crop yields, and thus can be treated as a very important shift in crop yields. The use of GMO crops also has a strong role to play in climate change adaptation, and limiting the development of these crops has the potential to greatly worsen the damage caused by climate change. Additionally, the increase in crop yields has the potential to reduce the amount of land that needs to be diverted to agricultural use, and has the potential to <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/327/5967/812">greatly improve global food security</a> [6. Godfray, H. Charles J., John R. Beddington, Ian R. Crute, Lawrence Haddad, David Lawrence, James F. Muir, Jules Pretty, Sherman Robinson, Sandy M. Thomas, and Camilla Toulmin. &#8220;Food security: the challenge of feeding 9 billion people.&#8221; science 327, no. 5967 (2010): 812-818.] and reduce global poverty. </p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The Gawker Media lawsuit involving a leaked sex tape of Hulk Hogan brings up some interesting issues relating to freedom of the press, particularly after the involvement of billionaire Silicon Valley entrepreneur Peter Thiel in spending 10 million dollars to fund the lawsuit came to light. Valleywag, a gossip publication owned by Gawker Media, outed Thiel, and Thiel wanted to find a plaintiff who has grounds to litigate against the publication. Richard Waters at the Financial Times covers this case <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/3ecb9de6-23b6-11e6-aa98-db1e01fabc0c.html">here</a>  [1. The article is paywalled and titled &#8220;Gawker fight pits Silicon Valley against the media&#8221; in the online edition and &#8220;Gawker lawsuit puts media on the ropes&#8221; published in the May 28, 2016, edition of the paper&#8217;s Kindle edition (I have a copy of the kindle edition)]. Scott Greenfield at Simple Justice has written a number of essays critical of the verdict, most recently, <a href="http://blog.simplejustice.us/2016/05/26/peter-thiel-hero-of-the-big-lie/">this one</a> [2. An archived version is at http://www.webcitation.org/6htnboS9w]. <a href="http://www.pragcap.com/three-things-i-think-i-think-weekend-edition-7/">Cullen Roche deals with the case here</a> [3. An archived link is here http://www.webcitation.org/6htnnhtKj].  The case is pending appeal, but Gawker Media lost 140 million dollars in a jury verdict &#8212; enough to force the company into bankruptcy. Gawker Media owns a number of large websites, including, celebrity gossip blog Gawker, advice blog Lifehacker, feminist blog Jezebel, gaming blog Kotaku, and automotive blog Jalopnik [4. Probably, if Gawker Media does go bankrupt, some of its better sites will return/persist under new ownership.]. I am of two minds on this case. On one side Gawker&#8217;s content is pure garbage, and the publication has a business model of publishing content as scandalous as possible and in skirting the lines of ethics and legality in doing so. It very well may have crossed the line in the Hulk Hogan case. However, particularly when the involvement of Thiel is included, the case provides a mechanism by which public figures can destroy a publication that prints stories which are critical of them. It should be very hard for someone of public prominence to win litigation versus journalists &#8212; even tabloid ones. Additionally, this issue tends to be magnetic to hypocrites of many types. Free speech advocates who in most cases would defend Gawker, but who are clearly motivated by disdain for the publication&#8217;s political views and clearly protected speech in their interpretation of this case [5. Thiel, who has strongly libertarian political views may be the archetype here.] are common. And then there are people who agree with the publication&#8217;s opinions in other areas, but who are defending in in strong contrast to how they handle other issues. [6. Gawker Media itself may be of note here, considering how hostile the publication is to the ideas of free speech and open discourse&#8211; when the opinions in regard are ones it disagrees with]</p>
<p><strong>Legal Background</strong> </p>
<p>A lot of the popular coverage of the Gawker Media case focus on privacy rights. But for the most part, those were secondary to the actual litigation. The courts have been very hesitant to establish privacy as a free standing exemption to free speech. In practice, most of the Gawker litigation was over 1) publicity rights , and 2) the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress. Publicity rights are a type of intellectual property right that allow an individual to control how his likeness is used in the media. They are similar to trademarks. Out of the two possible justifications, the publicity rights ones is probably the strongest of the two. And as to the large damage awards, remember, Hogan is a celebrity with a large economic value contained in his brand + punitive damages. Gawker was rather open in flaunting Hogan&#8217;s privacy in this case, and pretty clearly didn&#8217;t give a shit about the law. To make matters worse about a month after the Hogan case Gawker published editorials condemning other celebrity nude leaks &#8212; meaning they outright knew their actions were legally dubious and unethical. That&#8217;s not endearing to a judge and jury &#8212; and willful intent to harm gets penalized more than negligence. And damages are counted in large part on the economic damage caused. Hogan has a marketable brand in his name, and this was damaged by the leak of the sex tape. The damages are in part to make up for that. It looks like 1/3rd of the damages were for the direct economic damage to him, and the rest were punitive. </p>
<p><strong>The Thiel Intervention </strong><br />
Theil&#8217;s intervention in this case doesn&#8217;t worry me too much, although the idea could be taken in some negative ways by others. <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/435937/peter-thiels-crusade-against-gawker-threat-free-speech">As David French notes</a> [7. Archived link at http://www.webcitation.org/6hu1ZeE6M], what Thiel did wasn&#8217;t too different from what many activist groups do on a regular basis. Thiel wanted a legal environment that was more hostile to the type of clickbait emitted by Gawker. He found a test case that could advance this goal and funded it. One could question if his goal was the right one in this case, but that is for the courts and the political process to decide. </p>
<p>However, Thiel&#8217;s intervention in the case came pretty close to the boundary of acceptability, and may cause others to act in ways that truly cross the boundary due to the visibility of this case. You could imagine a world in which he was more aggressive in finding cases (ie. if he combed through all of Gawker Media&#8217;s activities and solicited the possibility of litigation with everyone who may have a grievance with Gawker. Or you could imagine a world in which the quality of the litigation was much lower. Thiel didn&#8217;t cross this line, but I expect others to in the near future. </p>
<p><strong>Here is the side of me that is against Gawker</strong></p>
<p>Gawker Media&#8217;s coverage on most issues tends to be one of these<br />
<iframe src="//giphy.com/embed/26FPy3QZQqGtDcrja" width="480" height="320" frameborder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p><a href="http://giphy.com/gifs/fire-dumpster-26FPy3QZQqGtDcrja">via GIPHY</a></p>
<p>Gawker Media sites have been toxic little outfits that regularly take a dump on peoples&#8217; privacy, and emit nasty outrage peddling on the media landscape. Its political publications have probably damaged the landscape of political discourse quite a bit. They very well may have finally taken things too far into the world of illegality, and now are paying the price. On the other hand, Gawker may have been 1) infringing on copyrights, publicity rights, and other areas outside of the zone of protected speech, 2) not really furthering the public debate on government policy or anything else that comes under a justification for its actions. This means that a lot of the usual justifications for strong freedom of the press go out of the window. Gawker was hardly publishing the Pentagon Papers, and may have (if the trial court ruling is upheld) doing an activity that is actually illegal. </p>
<p><strong>&#8230;.But</strong><br />
It is clear that a lot of Gawker Media&#8217;s stuff crossed the line of social acceptability. But whether it crossed the legal line, and whether the verdict aginst Gawker will be upheld is uncertain.  You can imagine cases where similar material can be perfectly news-worthy (ie. Anthony Weiner). You don&#8217;t want a legal system that discourages that type of coverage. It may be useful to distinguish between those in the public spotlight and private figures with little news worthiness. Criticisms of those in the public spotlight are very valuable even if trashy at times. And it should be very hard to litigate aginst even the trashiest of content in such debates, so as to avoid creating a chilling effect on all of discourse. It is also worrisome to see that the Gawker Media controversy has brought out some dangerous ideas regarding free-speech. The freedom of speech is not freedom from consequences people (particularly when the consequences here are state-enforced), and the people who dismiss the free speech implications altogether (ie. the one liners I&#8217;ve seen on FB like &#8220;freedom of speech means that the best you can say for your action are that they aren&#8217;t actually illegal&#8221;, and &#8220;defending Gawker in this case is like using freedom of religion to defend Kim Davis&#8221; [8. This one-liner reminds me of this  http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/07/22/freedom-on-the-centralized-web/ http://www.webcitation.org/6hu2ICg8S <i>&#8220;It would be paranoid to say that there are people for whom fighting against free speech is a terminal value, but let me make a slightly weaker claim. There are people who consider themselves the protectors of decency, who notice that their opponents are usually using the value &#8216;free speech&#8217; to oppose their demands, and so &#8216;free speech&#8217; to these people becomes the equivalent of &#8216;small government&#8217; or “tolerance and equality” or “family values” – a value which most people agree is good, but which has gotten claimed by one side of a political argument so hard that for the other side it becomes an outgroup signal and sign of cringeworthy bad arguments which must be shot down. These people don’t quite have fighting free speech as a terminal value, but you might as well model them as if they do. These are the people who say &#8216;freeze peach&#8217; in the same way other people say &#8216;but mah jawbs!&#8217;</i>&#8220;]). Such sentiments are very dangerous to the future of political discourse. </p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I just saw this old <a href="http://www.interfluidity.com/v2/4340.html">post on Interfludity</a> [1. archived at http://www.webcitation.org/6hpqkeu3b], The generalized resource curse, linked from somewhere that I read. In that essay, Steve Randy Waldman argues that the growth in automation will cause a dynamic that is similar to the effect that natural resources have on developing economies. In what is known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_curse">resource curse</a>, economies with many natural resources &#8212; particularly ones that can be easily extracted like oil and minerals &#8212; tend to have sluggish economic performance. This is because the resource can be easily captured by corrupt officials, damaging both the economic and the political performance of the country, as the wealth contained in the resource is diverted to the personal coffers of the officials who captured it. Very few workers are needed to manage the resource and they have little bargaining power. Waldman predicts that a similar dynamic will happen with automation. Automation will create a form of capital that is very core to how the economy functions, requires very little labor to tend, and which can be easily captured. This will damage the overall political system. According to him, it will concentrate power in the hands of the people who own this capital.</p>
<p>However, I am not fully on board with this analysis. I have a few objections 1) the resource curse dynamic is really a phenomenon of authoritarian states, and democracies have largely avoided it, 2) the evidence shows that the dictatorship came before the cursed resource ie. a cursed resource can give a dictator political strength, but is unlikely to rapidly distort the political system of an established democracy, 3) the type of automation capital at question here is fundamentally different from natural resources in its ability to generate economic rents of the relevant kind, and 4) the type of dysfunctional political system common to resource curse economies is mutually contradictory with the requirements of advanced industrial production of the type that could produce an automation curse.</p>
<p>One of the favorite things I&#8217;ve read recently is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selectorate_theory">selectorate model of politics</a>, developed by Mesquita et. al. in their academic book <em>The Logic of Political Survival</em> and in their popular book <em>The Dictator&#8217;s Handbook</em>. In this model, there is a tension between a politician&#8217;s choice to provide broad-based services that benefit most of the population, and private goods that benefit the supporters of the politician. The same money can&#8217;t be used for both. Rulers in both dictatorships and democracies need to get support from others. The main difference in political systems is the number of people in the winning coalition of supporters that the politician needs to remain in power [2. It is worth noting that Mesquita et. al do not mean &#8220;coalition&#8221; in the sense of parliamentary collation but instead means the set of supporters that the politician needs to win over. In a democracy, this can come close to the set of voters needed to win an election, although factors such as affinity voting can attenuate this] . The cost of providing private goods scales with the number of people in the winning coalition and the cost of providing public goods scales with the size of the total population of the country. This means large coalition governments (ie. well-functioning democracies) are much more likely to spend on public goods than small collation governments (ie. dictatorships). As Mesquita et. al. note [3. See page 89 of The Dictator&#8217;s Handbook], this has a direct role in explaining the resource curse. The types of resources behind the resource curse provide an efficient source of steady revenue for the dictator. When a dictatorship has a cursed resource in its country this revenue can be diverted for private goods adding strength to the dictator&#8217;s government. But a democracy will tend to use its resources to fund widely beneficial goods. This means that, based on a theoretical perspective, one would expect democracies to be a lot less prone to resource curse dynamics.</p>
<p>When the level of political freedom of the country is taken into account the resource curse goes away, and resources become a benefit. I wrote an R script to calculate the correlation between oil production and human development index [4. HDI was chosen instead of per capita GDP as a measure of development to account for an Equatorial Guniea type situation where you can have a resource cursed economy that has a high GDP but poor indicators in every other area.]. But, I adjusted this for the level of political freedom measured by <em>The Economist&#8217;s</em> Democracy Index, and for <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/04/02/beware-regional-scatterplots/">spatial autocorrelation</a> [5. archived link at http://www.webcitation.org/6hsYCVVZz]. There was a strong <em>positive</em> correlation between development and oil, once this was done. [6. The script is Resource.R in this repository <a href="https://github.com/theojones2/shiny-palm-tree">https://github.com/theojones2/shiny-palm-tree</a> and the data are also in the repository.] Code and results embedded at the end of the post.</p>
<p>And the possibility that cursed resources cause the formation of dictatorships is also lacking in evidence <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2008/07/the-perplexing.html">as noted by Mark Thoma</a> [7. The archived link at http://www.webcitation.org/6hsYljSbW ]. While institutions are not improved by oil wealth, they are not harmed either.</p>
<p>Additionally, the resource curse is closely tied to the possibility of economic rents produced from oil. Wealth from oil is effectively free, as long as you have the oil on your land. Dysfunctional institutions don&#8217;t really harm oil production. The same can not be said of the type of manufacturing at question in Waldman&#8217;s article. The production of that type can not go on if institutions are bad. Government policy can destroy the manufacturing base.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Scott Alexander recently did an article on <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/05/23/three-great-articles-on-poverty-and-why-i-disagree-with-all-of-them/">poverty and its causes</a>  [1. archived link at http://www.webcitation.org/6hmVgMK7u ].  Both in the comments for that article, and in a footnote was the claim that a large-scale expansion of welfare spending and a large-scale expansion of immigration are incompatible policies, &#8220;<em>And then there’s the whole open borders idea, which probably isn’t very compatible with basic income at all.</em>&#8221; In this post, I will discuss the relationship between welfare programs and immigration, and I will discuss how both goals might be navigated.</p>
<p>There are two types of issues that a greatly expanded welfare system interacting with greatly expanded immigration could create</p>
<ol>
<li>The welfare migration issue. You don&#8217;t want large numbers of people migrating primarily for the possibility of accessing social services.</li>
<li>The underclass issue. You don&#8217;t want an underclass of migrants that are deprived of substantial participation in the economic and or political system.</li>
</ol>
<p>These two issues create a bit of a tradeoff. You don&#8217;t welfare migration, but if you let immigrants in but cut them off, you risk creating an underclass (if the immigration levels are sufficiently large).</p>
<p>There is also the income effect issue, where, even when immigrating for good reasons immigrants may net use government services due to having lower than average incomes. However, I am not sure this is an inherent problem, even if it results in some net harm to the native born. To the extent that immigration restrictions have allowed the income of the typical American to exceed what is viable for the rest of the world, they are unjustified, and net harmful to the typical person in the world. The maintenance of this advantage is not sufficient justification for restrictions on immigration in my opinion. However, such issues do provide practical political issues for those wanting to reduce immigration restrictions.</p>
<p>The studies I will discuss show enough of an effect of benefits on migration to be significant, but one that is sufficiently small as to not be catastrophic. I believe that the optimal way of navigating these tradeoffs are to phase in benefits based on time spent by the immigrant in the country, while still dramatically increasing the number of immigrants allowed into the country. This can be done even when the level of benefits provided is increasing or even when a BIG is enacted.</p>
<p><strong>How Big a Deal is Welfare Migration </strong></p>
<p>In order to find out to what extent immigrants could be driven to migrate for increased benefit access, it is useful to look at what happens within countries, and within free-migration zones like the European Union. Current cross-country migration to countries like the U.S is less relevant for this because the process of admission of immigrants is in part designed to filter out such people.</p>
<p>De Giorgi et. al. in their 2009 paper <em> <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537109000062">Welfare migration in Europe</a></em> [2. De Giorgi, Giacomo, and Michele Pellizzari. &#8220;Welfare migration in Europe.&#8221; Labour Economics 16, no. 4 (2009): 353-363. Harvard ], published in the journal <em>Labour Economics</em>, looked into the extent to which the expansion of the European Union caused welfare migration. They found &#8220;<em>a significant but small effect of the generosity of welfare on migration decisions &#8230; large enough to distort the distribution of migration flows</em>&#8220;. They found that an increase in the typical welfare benefit could be predicted to have about 37% of the effect that a wage increase of the same relative proportion would have. De Giorgi et. al. looked at the correlation between the generosity of welfare benefits (as measured by &#8220;the ratio between income out of work – i.e. from welfare benefits – and income in work – i.e. some measure of the average wage&#8221;) and migration patterns. They controlled for the average wage and unemployment rate. They got their data on migration levels by country and time of migration from The European Community Household Panel and their data on welfare benefits from The OECD Database on Benefit Entitlements and Replacement Rates.</p>
<p>Terra McKinnish&#8217;s 2006 paper <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3177299/"><em> Welfare-induced migration at state borders: New evidence from micro-data</em></a>, published in the <em>Journal of Public Economics, </em>[3. McKinnish, Terra. &#8220;Welfare-induced migration at state borders: New evidence from micro-data.&#8221; <i>Journal of public Economics</i> 91, no. 3 (2007): 437-450.] looks at how state by state differences in welfare spending in the United States affects migration between U.S states. She found evidence of welfare migration. While the correlation that indicates welfare migration is clear and significant, there is low confidence about the estimate of the magnitude of this effect  due to the low statistical significance of the estimate of the magnitude. They estimate that every $100/year increase in AFDC benefits will &#8220;increase the welfare participation of in-migrants by 0.32 percentage points relative to native-born&#8221;. She used data from the U.S Census Bureau.</p>
<p>The 2003 paper by Kaestner et. al. <em><a href="https://core.ac.uk/download/files/153/6707936.pdf">Migration consequences of welfare reform</a></em> published in the Journal of Urban Economics [4. Kaestner, Robert, Neeraj Kaushal, and Gregg Van Ryzin. &#8220;Migration consequences of welfare reform.&#8221; Journal of Urban Economics 53, no. 3 (2003): 357-376.Harvard ] looked at the effect of the late 1990s welfare reforms on migration between U.S states. They found that the reductions in benefits were correlated with an &#8221; increase in employment-related intrastate migration, and a decrease in non-employment related migration, both within and between states.&#8221; The probability of inter-state migration was reduced by 0.4 absolute percentage points or 12 relative percentage points. They used data from the U.S Census Bureau.</p>
<p>A 2008 paper by Dahlberg et. al. published in the <em>Journal of Public Economics </em> titled &#8220;<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Karin_Edmark2/publication/222576687_Is_there_a_race-to-the-bottom_in_the_setting_of_welfare_benefit_levels_Evidence_from_a_policy_intervention._J_Public_Econ_92(5-6)1193-1209/links/0046352452b41b8e43000000.pdf"><em>Is There a &#8216;Race-to-the-Bottom&#8217; in the Setting of Welfare Benefit Levels? Evidence from a Policy Intervention</em></a>&#8221; [5.  Dahlberg, Matz, and Karin Edmark. &#8220;Is there a “race-to-the-bottom” in the setting of welfare benefit levels? Evidence from a policy intervention.&#8221; <i>Journal of Public Economics</i> 92, no. 5 (2008): 1193-1209.], looks at the extent to which migration effects can produce race to the bottom effects in Swedish municipalities. They find that there is such a race to the bottom effect and that &#8220;the effect is economically as well as statistically significant; if the neighboring municipalities decrease their welfare benefit level by 100 SEK, a municipality decreases its benefit level with approximately 41 SEK&#8221;.</p>
<p>De Giorgi et. al., note that the effect of cross-nation immigration, could be presumed to be lower, because of the higher costs and cultural differences with such migration.</p>
<p>Jan Ekberg in a 1999 paper in the Journal of Population Economics titled &#8220;<a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s001480050106">Immigration and the public sector: Income effects for the native population in Sweden</a>&#8221; [6. Ekberg, Jan. &#8220;Immigration and the public sector: Income effects for the native population in Sweden.&#8221; Journal of Population Economics 12, no. 3 (1999): 411-430.Harvard ] looked into the net effects of immigration on the public treasury in Sweden. Sweden is useful for comparison here because it can show what could happen under greatly larger levels of welfare spending, without the restrictions on immigrant eligibility that occur in the U.S. They find that &#8220;there are negative income effects due to the deteriorating employment situation among the immigrants. The yearly positive or negative income effects have at most been 1–2% of the gross national product&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Ways Forward</strong></p>
<p>The benefits of increased immigration are sufficiently large and the effects of immigration effects are sufficiently small that I think it is possible to increase immigration levels by a very large level while still creating a net positive effect. I would suggest that immigrants should be completely ineligible for any benefits for a few years after arrival and that there should be a proportional phase in thereafter. Ie. 1/5 of the benefit the first year of eligibility, 2/5 during the second, and so, on. In the U.S <a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/basic-report/summary-immigrant-eligibility-restrictions-under-current-law">there are already such time limits in effect</a>[7. Archived link at http://www.webcitation.org/6hmldrnhc], where eligibility for most social programs does not occur until five years of residency in the U.S. This has helped to keep the fiscal effect of immigrants to the U.S net-positive unlike in Sweden. This type of mechanism partially resolves the underclass issue by providing some eligibility within a few years, but deters immigration for benefits, and allows positive revenue to accumulate the first few years of the immigrant presence (reducing income effects). In short, I think the welfare migration race to the bottom issues are small enough to be mitigable, and the income effect issues are both somewhat small and possible to ameliorate and such that it is dubious on normative grounds to use them as grounds to restrict migration.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Lets say that you are a drug company. Your drug for $disease has been successful, but your exclusive marketing rights and patents are about to expire. What do you do? Simple. Create a variant of it with a bit of dye or something else that is non-clinically active. Run a clinical trial on that sucker. But this time focus it on <i>women</i> (or the demographic of your choice). The trial will almost certainly be successful, because you know your drug works on the population as a whole, and women kind of have a few similarities with the human population as a whole. Now you have a drug that treats $disease in <i>women</i>. Exclusive marketing rights time.</p>
<p>This pretty much happens straight up with <a href="http://www.webcitation.org/6hZjEPzQL">so called Me-Too drugs</a> [1. now dead original link was https://www.optum.com/resources/library/metoodrugs.html archived link at http://www.webcitation.org/6hZjEPzQL and http://archive.is/I5l0i]. But the same general tactic is good for think-tanks who want to mislead people.</p>
<p>On social media I saw, the following article linked, with the following section quoted<br />
http://www.progressivepolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2015.11-Gerwin_The-Trans-Pacific-Partnership-and-Small-Business_Boosting-Exports-and-Inclusive-Growth.pdf</p>
<blockquote><p>The average women- owned exporting firm, for example, employs over five times more workers and pays an average salary almost $17,000 higher than non-exporting firms owned by women&#8230;..</p></blockquote>
<p> [2. Archived link at http://www.webcitation.org/6iWfrtBnt ]<br />
Trade improves gender equality. Sounds good.</p>
<p>At first I was wondering what causes the gender aspect here. Do cross culture differences suppress the effect of sexism? And then I realized that the article was a non-peer reviewed article from a think-tank with a strong view on trade (the Progressive Policy Institute). What do we know about ideological think tanks? Ah yes. They exist to promote their political views. If this means being misleading, then so be it. I got really skeptical when the paper had no comparison to other demographic groups (except minorities).</p>
<p>I then checked the source for that article, which was this article from the Census Bureau http://www2.census.gov/econ/sbo/07/sbo_export_report.pdf [3. Archived link at http://www.webcitation.org/6iWgU3GBH ]</p>
<p>Turns out the PPI did the drug company trick mentioned above. That number is purely an artifact of the fact that exporting firms are larger than purely domestic ones. Actually, women owned exporters are actually smaller companies than their man owned counterparts (seems to have something to do with the strong performance of veteran owned firms, as a strong majority of veterans are men).</p>
<p>In statistics this type of manipulation is pretty easy in cases where you can divide things up into arbitrary subgroups. See also the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modifiable_areal_unit_problem">modifiable areal unit problem</a> [4. Archived link at http://archive.is/LI9Nh].</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I think there is a big issue in the structure of Twitter, Facebook and other social media content silos. These services try to be a jack of all trades, and wind up being a master of none.</p>
<p>There are five roles that a communication service can fulfill,</p>
<ol>
<li>1 to 1 communication between two individuals (ie. personal email)</li>
<li>one to many communication (ie. a newspaper)</li>
<li>a group of like-minded individuals coming together to discuss a matter of common interest (ie. an Internet forum for conservatives)</li>
<li>a community of people with, disparate views to come together and discuss those differences (ie. a broader focus Internet forum)</li>
<li>core infrastructure that serves a bunch of unrelated users with different interests and goals (ie. a webhost).</li>
</ol>
<p>Your typical content silo tries to be all five, and this creates a lot of problems, and tensions.</p>
<h3 id="differing-expectations-and-sealions">Differing Expectations and Sealions</h3>
<p>This creates people with different expectations of what type of community they are dealing with. There are a lot of different communities and users with different goals. And sometimes these communities don’t get along. The structure of social media systems forces them into the same silo. This creates perverse outcomes.</p>
<p>Have you heard of the concept of sealioning? It refers the the tendency of a comment made on Twitter on a controversial subject, to attract a negative response from partisans on the issue. If you make a Tweet on a controversial subject, people will try to respond to you , and this can create some hostile dynamics. The phrase originates from <a href="http://wondermark.com/1k62/">a cartoon by David Malki</a>. In the cartoon, one character insults sealions in a conversation with another character. An anthropomorphic sealion then enters the conversation, and requests that the insulter justify the comment, and follows the insulter home.</p>
<p>The phrase <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/sea-lioning">came to prominence</a> during the whole #GamerGate shitshow. But it describes a situation that has preexisted that tirefire, and which still happens on many other issues. <a href="http://inthesetimes.com/article/18850/kind-of-discourse-we-need">Take the 2016 presidential election</a>, and the discussion about it on Twitter. Support a candidate, or oppose one vocally on Twitter, and you run the chance of getting a negative response from the partisans for that candidate. The supporters of both Trump and <a href="http://www.vox.com/2016/2/4/10918710/berniebro-bernie-bro">Sanders</a> are particularly known <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/10/here-comes-the-berniebro-bernie-sanders/411070/">for their aggression on social media</a> .</p>
<p>And then there is the strongly related phenomenon of the <a href="https://medium.com/@randileeharper/solving-twitter-dogpiles-7d7b102116c8#.f1q6hlo5i">Twitter dogpile</a>. In a dog-pile, someone writes a tweet that gets a lot of attention from other tweeters. Those angry at the offending tweet then send their responses to the original tweeter. The result is a flooding of the original tweeter with angry messages.</p>
<p>The tension between the different roles of Twitter is where the sealioning, dogpiling, and related issues comes from. Twitter (and other social media platforms) is at once functioning as a public forum for public discussion, and at once as a personalized medium. And its not navigating that impasse very well.</p>
<p>Remember the original cartoon. The sealion followed the person who insulted the sealion home home. And that’s what the people who complain about sealioning think is happening. Their vision of the purpose of Twitter is one in which they are dealing with like-minded people, or broadcasting their ideas to people who agree with them. Their conception of what Twitter is marks off 1,2,and three on my roles of a communication service, but they aren’t using Twitter for roles 4 and five. They look at their notifications and, like the sealioned person in the cartoon, see someone intruding on their home. Meanwhile, the person who is responding to the Tweet, thinks of Twitter as a way for people with disagreeing viewpoints to interact, and therefore thinks it is perfectly fine to rebut the person talking about how evil sealions are.</p>
<p>Considering the structure of Twitter, both have a point. The situation is at an impasse, and the structure of the platform tries to suit all possible uses at the expense of fulfilling none of them.</p>
<h3 id="censorship">Censorship</h3>
<p>This also creates some of the controversies over censorship. Social networks are in large part acting as core infrastructure, while also serving as content and communities on top of that infrastructure.</p>
<p>There are communities, and there are protocols. Infrastructure means there must be what in a decentralized system would be a protocol for communication. Protocols tend to have a strong tendency towards natural monopolies due to network effects. A communication protocol is only useful to the extent that other people are using it. Unless there are very strong intensives the other way, you will use the most popular protocol. The market will therefore become quite concentrated and non-competitive.</p>
<p>This has happened on lower levels of Internet-based protocols. Gopher lost the competition to HTTP. And so on.</p>
<p>In the pre-social media world, there was a separation between the communities themselves and the This website is a discrete community, and the VPS I host it on implements various protocols to allow users to get access to the content. But, as long as everyone agrees on the protocol itself, there can be competition on the higher levels of the system. There can be many blogs and fora with different owners served over HTTP. There can even be competition on the infrastructure level.</p>
<p>The multiple roles of most social networks serve to combine protocol with implementation. This makes the type of diversity of different communities and implementations that dominated the pre-social web impossible. It serves to concentrate substantial power over the Internet and the discourse that happens on it into the owners of these systems.</p>
<p>And its important infrastructure. Social media sites contain so much of Internet discourse that if your opinion is blocked from them, then you are at a severe disadvantage in getting it out. They are so powerful that by taking sides on political issues they could alter the discourse on those issues quite a bit. Its safe to say that both Sanders and Trump are social media candidates– if social media wasn’t available to them, then they couldn’t sustain their campaign solely on traditional media. FiveThirtyEight has a <a href="http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/facebook-primary/">post up showing the social media mentions of each candidate for president</a> , if you want a visualization of this. Major social media websites taking sides on political issues could very quickly alter the whole political discourse of the country. Social media services and other Internet infrastructure.</p>
<p>The real problem and controversy comes from the dual roles of social media —- Twitter/Facebook/Tumblr isn’t purely infrastructure. They are also communities. The infrastructure role of these services pushes them in the direction of needing ideological diversity and tolerance for a wide range of varying viewpoints.</p>
<p>The community-like nature of these pushes them in the other direction.</p>
<p>This is in large part because the different communities can affect each other. If my webhost also hosted a neo-nazi blog, it wouldn’t affect my site very much. The neo-nazis could read their site, and my readers could read mine. But if a bunch of neo-nazis started using Twitter, then there would be clear leakage on the other users. And this could damage the reputation of Twitter. One remark that I’ve seen a few times on this issue: If a bunch of Hells Angles start attending your bar, then you become a Hells Angles bar unless you kick them out. If you are in the same tightly knit Internet community as some pretty terrible people – then those terrible people are going to affect you. Again an impasse created by the dual roles of Twitter.</p>
<h3 id="toxic-communities">Toxic communities</h3>
<p>The big social networks also tend to have some pretty nasty issues with toxic subcultures, and sub-communities. Tumblr is probably the worst in this vein. The site’s fandom and social justice sub-community wars have given the site a name in the broader Internet community.</p>
<p>And on Twitter you get toxic groups forming a collective group and becoming a menace to other users. This type of issue is definitely seen with tire-fires such as #GamerGate where you get a whole sub-community form that is a big dump of toxic on the rest of the users of the system.</p>
<p>The same leakage issue created by dual roles that I mentioned earlier applies here. When you have toxic neighbors, its hard to avoid their effects on your usage of the service.</p>
<p>But the multiple communication services roles problem creates another issue here. It becomes very difficult for the sub-communities to self-moderate. In a proper Internet forum the ban-hammer is always a option, and in well functioning communities often applied. Due to the broad,based infrastructure-like roles of the social networks, the banhammer is applied very lightly. Sub-communities can not eject their malefactors. The Bernie Sanders supporter community on Twitter can not eject the toxic berniebros that engage in crude and sexist behavior. If instead of Twitter, they were on an Internet forum dedicated towards their politics – the gentle, warm glow of the banhammer could be applied to these types. Both the reputation of the wider community and the ability for proper discourse to happen is greatly damaged.</p>
<h3 id="path-forward">Path Forward</h3>
<p>In the short run, social media services can address this issue by <a href="https://medium.com/art-marketing/putting-out-the-twitter-trashfire-3ac6cb1af3e#.8mten26a4">adding features</a> to their services that allow users to have more control over the messages they see. This control can allow users to adjust the nature of the service as used by them so that it is better suited to them. This could take the form of opt in filtering, options to adjust the user interface, options to suppress notifications, and opt-in blocklists.</p>
<p>However, this type of adjustment will not work in the long run . I think these problems are an inherent problem in the design of current social networking services, one that will eventually lead to their decline, and replacement with services that handle each type of Internet communication more individually. Solving these structural issues will 1) require returning to the decentralization of the pre-social media web, 2) replacing current social networks with general protocols, and 3) creating separate protocols for each major type of communication .</p>
<p>The reason Twitter type services gained popularity is more their ease of use, then their structure. Users want a presence on the web, one that is personalized, and that allows them to connect with others. The old, pre-social network web, had fewer of these issues. All of the major communication functions were well-separated. Discrete communities were isolated.</p>
<p>The problem here was ease of use. Getting an Internet presence outside of the use of social media services takes substantial technical skill. Skill that most users do not have. The first feature that a good social network replacement should have is ease of use.</p>
<p>Decentralization is also important. Current centralized social networking websites, such as Facebook have many flaws. They have persistent privacy issues and breaches. Their moderation policies are often problematic and applied arbitrarily. These systems are vulnerable to censorship and government manipulation. The risks of this to privacy are shown by the NSA leaks. The risks to <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2238519/Facebook-bans-picture-woman-reclining-bathtub--shows-elbow.html">free speech are shown by how, when under pressure from the Turkish government Facebook restricted posts advocating</a> Kurdish independence and “Any attack on Ataturk [Turkey’s first president]”. With a centralized structure these issues of government interference are almost unavoidable. The nature of these networks also means that there is little ability for the user to modify and customize the interface because all of the code runs on the server, and because this code is not open source. This is part of the reason why Facebook has to roll out interface changes to all users, often with many dissatisfied users. Some projects have tried to improve the Facebook interface by running client-side software that modifies the HTML and JavaScript produced by Facebook, but this method is error prone. A distributed social network built around a single protocol that allows different implementations of the system, running on different servers would fix these issues. A decentralized social network would lessen all of the issues I discussed. If individuals run their own servers, governments would have a hard time controlling these servers. A decentralized system would allow many different implementations and configurations of the system to run. The users would be allowed to choose from the configuration that best suits their wants. They would also be able to chose from different hosts of the system.</p>
<p>A path forward will require the creation of new services that implement the flexibility of the old web, with the ease of use of modern social networking services.</p>
