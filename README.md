This is static html files made from the old versions of my personal blog theojones.name.

I've reopened my blog with a new design and I am gradually going to move over some of the old posts from the old website. I decided to start fresh because the method I was using of keeping the old posts in a separate archive blog was getting cumbersome, and because I have moved some of my shorter, microblog-type content over to my Tumblr page, and because a lot of the older content is filled with broken links, and stuff I have changed viewpoints on. 

Keeping the old content on this repository is a comprimise here. 
The archive.theojones.name folder is for posts that are very old (more than a year). The simply-static-1-1473299023-theojones repo is for posts that are more recent (mostly also copied over to the tumblelog https://theopjones.tumblr.com/

All of my posts here relicenced under cc0 https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/  (even when the text of the posts indicates otherwise)
