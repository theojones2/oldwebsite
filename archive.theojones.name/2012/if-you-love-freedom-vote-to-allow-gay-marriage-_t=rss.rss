<p>Last week, in a dangerously misguided decision, North Carolina voters passed a referendum banning gay marriage. In a freedom loving country this referendum makes no sense because gay marriage is simply a matter of preserving and extending liberty and equality to all. Anti-gay marriage advocates are often (if not usually) motivated by either severely misguided and false stereotypes and/or a desire to force everyone to conform to their conservative religious code of morality. Gay marriage bans are unjust infringements on the rights and freedoms of gay Americans. These bans violate the Equal Protection Clause found in the 14<sup>th</sup> Amendment to the U.S Constitution and deprive a large group of liberties protected by the Constitution. There's no justification for current bans on gay marriage.</p>

<p><a name="__DdeLink__0_472281813"></a> Marriage licenses provide many important legal benefits. A 2004 study by the United States General Accounting Office found that 1,138 federal laws use marital status as a factor in determining or receiving benefits, rights, and privileges. According to the Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance (OCRT), <a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/aboutus.htm">a nonsectarian group that</a> "<em>that promotes the freedom of individuals to follow the religious path of their choosing, without discrimination or oppression</em>", <a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/hom_marr.htm">these include benefits</a> to individuals that affect their "<em>Social Security, Medicare, medical leave, and other benefits; property inheritance; the right to visit their spouse in hospital, and make medical decisions if they are incapacitated; security of the couple and of their children</em>". This means gay couples lack the financial security of married couples and the right to have their partner involved in critical decisions if they become incapacitated.</p>

<p>The liberty and well-being of gays is also threatened by the hostility they face. A <a href="http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/resources/policy/ohio-marriage.aspx">statement issued by the American Psychological Association</a> notes that "<em>Taken together, the evidence clearly supports the position that the social stigma, prejudice, discrimination, and violence associated with not having a heterosexual sexual orientation and the hostile and stressful social environments created thereby adversely affect the psychological, physical, social, and economic well-being of lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals.</em>" Bans on gay marriage reinforce these stereotypes and contribute to discrimination against gay couples. These stereotypes, in turn, sometimes lead to bullying, harassment, and even violence against gays and gay couples.</p>

<p><a name="__DdeLink__8_472281813"></a><a name="__DdeLink__10_472281813"></a> The Declaration of Independence says, "<em>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness</em>". If you believe in this principle, as I do, you must conclude that everyone should be entitled to liberty and equality and that freedom should be limited only insofar as is required for everyone else to enjoy liberty.</p>

<p>Conservatives advocating bans on gay marriage cannot show they will be harmed in any way by gay marriages. Many conservatives argue that permitting gay marriage will be corrosive to families and society. However, there is a great body of evidence that contradicts this assertion. A <a href="http://www.aaanet.org/issues/policy-advocacy/Statement-on-Marriage-and-the-Family.cfm">statement issued by the American Anthropological Association</a> states that "<em>The results of more than a century of anthropological research on households, kinship relationships, and families, across cultures and through time, provide no support whatsoever for the view that either civilization or viable social orders depend upon marriage as an exclusively heterosexual institution â€¦..a vast array of family types, including families built upon same-sex partnerships, can contribute to stable and humane societies</em>". I ask those conservatives who reject the vision of liberty for all including gay couples and those turning to religious dogma to consider is the Bible really a good guide for governance? Slavery, stoning, executing whole families for the crimes of one member, mass murder and genocide are <a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/imm_bibl.htm">all found in the Bible</a>. Are religious ideologues asking the government to enforce a biblical version of Sharia law?</p>

<p><a name="__DdeLink__140_472281813"></a><a name="__DdeLink__144_472281813"></a><a name="__DdeLink__146_472281813"></a> Gay marriage bans violate the Equal Protection Clause in the 14<sup>th</sup> Amendment, which reads "<em>No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.</em>" It's clear that gay marriage bans subject a group to unequal treatment. Discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender discrimination are both very similar, so courts should use the same standard to evaluate both. In <em>Craig v. Boren</em> (1976) the Supreme Court ruled gender discrimination is not permissiable unless it furthers an important government interest in a way that is substantially related to that interest. Some conservatives have tried to claim that the important government interest being promoted is the government's interest in promoting procreation through well structured marriage laws. While the government <em><span class="c1">may</span></em> have an important interest in maintaining population growth, gay marriage bans are not substantially related to that interest. Gay marriages wouldn't have a negative affect on heterosexual marriages. And gay marriage bans don't guarantee that the institution of marriage will remain strong. Marriage laws clearly have functions other than to encourage procreation. We don't require every married couple to have children. Along with the equal protection issues, laws that limit interstate recognition of gay marriages, such as the Defense of Marriage Act ,contradict the requirement in Article 4 of the Constitution that "<em>full faith and credit shall be given in each state to the public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of every other state</em>".</p>

<p>Gay marriage prohibitions are just wrong. There's no reality-based justification for discriminatory laws such as the the one passed in the North Carolina referendum. Opposition to gay marriage is fueled by religious fundamentalism and demagoguery from conservative political leaders. It is past time to repeal the wrongheaded and unconstitutional prohibitions of gay marriage that infringe the liberties of millions of people throughout America. If you love freedom, it's the right thing to do.</p>
