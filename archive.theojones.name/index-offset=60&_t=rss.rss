<p><a href="http://www.theojones.name/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/fed.jpg"><img src="http://www.theojones.name/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/fed.jpg" alt="fed" width="1000" height="572" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2446"></a>[podcast]<a href="https://objects.dreamhost.com:443/theopodcasts/MMT%20%26%20MM_01.mp3%5B/podcast%5DThere">https:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>objects.dreamhost.com:443/<wbr></wbr>theopodcasts/<wbr></wbr>MMT%20%26%20MM_01.mp3[/<wbr></wbr>podcast]There</a> are two recently popularized perspectives in economic theory that have a lot of promise. The first is post-Keynesian theories like Modern Monetary Theory. These emphasize the role of fiscal policy, and argue that the monetary system is fundamentally a legal construct. For a country with its own, floating currency the only constraints on fiscal policy are inflation and unemployment. If a government keeps its levels of deficit spending too low it can risk unemployment, but if it spends too much it risks inflation. Post-Keynesians treat taxes (and levels of spending) primarily are regulators of aggregate demand and the over-all money supply. Taxes destroy money, spending creates it. There is no "crowding out" of private sector debt caused by government spending. And MMTers/post-Keynesians dispute the role of the money multiplier as commonly understood. Banks can borrow directly from the Fed, and the Fed will expand the monetary base if interest rates slip from targets, making the money multiplier a useless formality with interest rates, and fiscal policy the real drivers of the money supply. It's a continuation of older Keynesian thought, but with a more sophisticated understanding of the monetary system. I think the main limitation on this train of thought is the mechanism through they wish to stabilize the economy. They advocate for a separation between aggregate demand stabilization and employment stabilization -- full employment AND price stability. One commonly proposed mechanism for this is the "job guarantee" wherein a government agency would provide employment to all unemployed people. The macroeconomic justification for this is reasonable, the politics and microeconomics of this is not. It would be an administrative train wreck. There would difficulties with creative socially useful employment in sufficient quantities (particularly when you are running this program in a near-full employment economy). There would be issues with hiring and firing while still maintaining the universal nature of the program. It sounds good in theory but would be hard to put into practice. Also post-Keynesians tend to rely very heavily on discretionary policy by policy makers in their response to fluctuations. This is problematic. Politicians tend to handle this very poorly. They either do what the US and the EU has done with the ongoing economic depression (they are not nearly aggressive enough in their policy making), or they way overspend (like in Venezuela) and engender inflation. The stabilization of the economy should be on autopilot. The second new-ish perspective in economic policy that I have sympathy towards is Market Monetarism. This is an extension of classic monetarism -- the idea that central banks should stabilize the level of growth of the money supply This has benefits over targeting inflation and/or price stability because there are clear ways that central banks can attempt to meet such a target, and a money supply target lacks some of the more arbitrary factors involved with other potential targets. But they bring a twist to this idea. They argue that central banks should target nominal GDP growth instead of the money supply. A prediction market can be used to determine the right level of money to inject into the economy to make this target. It's nice, clean, and mechanistic. A NGDP target as other benefits. It handles supply shocks (like oil price increases) pretty will compared to other targets. Inflation/price stability targeting would advise a massive bout of austerity in response to a supply shock, causing a depression and extreme unemployment. Employment targeting would advise the exact opposite, triggering a wage-price spiral and very high inflation. NGDP targeting would advise a balanced intermediate solution. Where market monetarists fall down is on their very strong reliance on monetary policy. They effectively think the NGDP could be stabilized by mass purchases of finical assets by central banks â€“ quantitative easing on steroids. This is problematic. Monetary policy, particularly when interest rates are very low is quite weak. And the level of purchases by central banks would 1) be very large, 2) involve politically problematic categories of asset, like foreign currency, and the debt of private companies.</p>

<p>I think it is possible to merge these two perspectives. The market monetarists are quite good at defending the NGDP target as a good target for macroeconomic stabilization, but have yet to convince me that monetary policy has what it takes. The post-Keynesians are quite good at defending the proper role of fiscal policy, but their exact policy proposals are problematic. The two ideas can be merged in my opinion. Target NGDP with fiscal policy. Enact a basic income plan, but with the exact levels of payment set based on a meeting the NGDP target. A prediction market can be useful for setting this level. You could even take this further and merge fiscal and monetary policy. Set interest rates at a constant level, and fund government deficits through creating new monetary base.</p>

<p>I've noticed that the hard left has a large amount of opposition to modernism and a good dose of what could be described as reactionaryism (the belief in the return to a past state). Sure, this is commonly (and perhaps almost exclusively) associated with the right-wing, but it's a huge element of some newer left-wing points of view. It's common to view reactionaryism solely in terms of classic social issues, and on these points reactionaryism is an inherently right-wing point of view. But there are other elements of policy and on these it's the left that wants to resist/reverse social progress. Additionally, this is one of the reasons why liberalism is NOT equivalent to progressivism/leftism. It's only an oddity of US politics that has made it seem like this is true. The range of political possibilities in the United States has be limited in such a way as to leave both progressives and liberals in agreement on all major issues of politics. I think this is beginning to change, and there will become an increasingly strong distinction between these two ideologies in the future. I would commit that within the next 10 or so years this will become a very noticeable distinction -- similar to the one that splits conservatives and libertarians. The dispute is fundamentally over the three pillars of enlightenment liberalism 1) science as the arbitrator of knowledge,2) democracy and due process as the arbitrator of political outcomes, and 3) individual liberty. Here are a few of the reactionary tendencies in the left wing viewpoint</p>
<ol><li>A dislike of science. This can be seen in issues like the debate over GMO's and similar conflicts. This can also be seen in the broader world of ideology. The world of left-leaning academic theory is almost overwhelmingly skeptical of the view that human society can be studied scientifically using the (largely quantative) methods commonly associated with the natural sciences. At the very least, this involves an emphasis on "other ways of knowing", and on the self-reported and analyzed "lived experiences" of people. This comes under such names as "structuralism" in the literature. The most extreme form of this comes under such names as post-structuralism and postmodernism and outright disputes the primacy of science even in the realm of the natural sciences, like physics and biology. This is of, course a highly problematic position, but is not at all rare in the world of diversity studies, and other left-leaning elements of the humanities.</li>
<li><p>Persistent clashes with freedom of speech. A lot of members of the modern left don't recognize the liberal distinction between speech and action. They have resurrected the ancient view that offensive speech or an attack on personal honor is an equivalent to physical violence. They act as if the advocacy of a course of action, or the belief that a course of action is within one's rights, or the attempt to participate in the political process, is equivalent to actually doing the action in question. This treatment of disagreeable speech as an equivalent of a physical attack also materializes into things like "trigger warnings" and the "safe place" movement. This bodes poorly for the underlying conception of democracy. Democracy feeds on public contestability and public debate of possible options. The vast majority of policy proposals will prove to be wrongheaded, and will be rightly rejected. But the process of free discourse and debate is absolutely essential to this process. Enlightenment civic republicanism came into existence in about the same time as science, because the two are innately linked. Both rely on decentralized finding of knowledge. In the case of science, this is for finding facts, in the case of democracy this is for determining how to run society. An attack on free speech is a full scale attack on both.</p></li>
<li><p>A neo-luddite view of technology and industrialization. Widespread industrialization and deployment of technology has vastly improved the standard of living of the typical person. However, many elements of the hard left want to return to a "small is beautiful" way of running the economy. An emphasis is put on small businesses and cooperatives. Some want a small scale and decentralized economy that looks a lot like the pre-industrial world. Its states' rights for progressives. And equally absurd. Despite its flaws, major firms can put in place a large degree of economic planning and stability that smaller firms cannot. They can leverage economies of scale, and they have vast efficiency improvements over smaller firms when they produce a uniform product Small is not efficient.</p></li>

Its the perfect fix to idiots on twitter with little potential for abuse. These blocklists are voluntary. In fact, voluntary, user directed filtering is much less abuse prone than its alternative -- the banhammer. If a killfile you got from somewhere is nuking stuff you want to see, just drop it.</p>

<p>How do you tell the difference between Twitter's new killfile options and McCarthyist censorship?  In one Commie McRed was prevented from talking to people who what to hear what he has to say. In the other, Gater McAsshole is being stopped from spewing to a captive audience who doesn't want to listen to him. Freedom of speech doesn't guarantee an audience. There will be people who don't want to hear what you have to say, and its their right to tune you out (as long as they don't try to stop you from reaching those who do want to hear you). McCarthyism was firing people for being part of the communist party. This twitter feature is more like telling your secretary you want all mailings from the communist party thrown away.</p>

<p>A lot of people try to pretend that censorship is something that can only exist when done by governments, that private actors cannot affect free speech in any meaningful way. This is absurd in my point of view. A right does not meaningfully exist if it cannot be effectively exercised. And private actors can easily put restraints on speakers that can make it very difficult to effectively participate<a href="http://www.theojones.name/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/3992988737_bebac07fb4_b.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2451" src="http://www.theojones.name/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/3992988737_bebac07fb4_b-300x189.jpg" alt="3992988737_bebac07fb4_b" width="300" height="189"></a> in politics or partake in free speech. The "freedom of speech isn't freedom of consequences" rejoinder that is commonly heard on internet debates isn't much better either. All censorship works by imposing consequences. The question on free speech is simply, what consequences are acceptable. On the other extreme, there are a lot of people who seem to act like that all criticism of a work they like is an attempt at censorship. This is at the very least a self-contradictory (although there is the easy to over-apply aside that an overly toxic social attitude towards a set of idea can make it very difficult to express them). A much better boundary for free speech versus censorship would be external versus internal consequences. An external consequence on speech is one that occurs through a factor other than the direct market for a work. An internal one comes from the market for the work, and the response from consumers to it. External consequences are often censorship, while internal ones are very rarely censorship. Examples of external consequences would include classic government censorship, threats to unrelated employment, harassment (i.e. SWATing, doxxing, etc.), deprivation of a resource that is generally available to all comers, attempts to pressure a publisher to drop a work by targeting unrelated ones, and so on. The problem with such external consequences comes from my belief that it is fundamentally problematic to use power gained in unrelated markets to muscle one's way into an advantageous position in the marketplace of ideas. Idea and art should rise and fall on their own terms, not the terms of who has the most power in society. It's a similar issue to anti-trust efforts. It is unjust for a company to use its power in one sector of the economy to blast out otherwise viable competitors in other sectors. A focus on external consequences as the demarcating like explains clearly why a lot of things are extremely problematic. Campaigns to target the employment of those with disfavored views (like what occurred in the Brendan Eich controversy) are unethical. <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/gamergate" class="p-category" rel="tag">#gamergate</a> style harassment campaigns against people speaking disfavored views are unethical. Campaigns to get stores to drop disfavored works by boycotting unrelated products are problematic (like the one that recently hit Target over the Grand Theft Auto video game). Attempts to pressure providers of generally available services like Facebook and Twitter to drop unpopular speakers are cases of censorship, Internal consequences would include the loss of market for a work due to consumer distaste, and regular editorial discretion by publishers. They are unavoidable and not necessarily unethical.</p>

<p>Climate Progress used to be one of the better blogs on the climate change issue, particulary when it was pretty much Joe Rohm's site. But then the Center for American Progress (its host) decided to shake things up a little bit, and its quality tanked.

Hereâ€™s Why That Matters For The Environment."</p>
