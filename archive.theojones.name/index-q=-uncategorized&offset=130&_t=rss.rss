<p>There is a large difference between how scientists/engineers and economists/business leaders about how efficiency in the economy is viewed. Scientists tend to look at efficiency as minimizing the materials and labor needed to reach a tangible outcome (such as an increase in life expectancy, or general well being). I will call this material efficiency  However, economists tend to look at efficiency as maximizing the goods and services produced in the economy -- even if the production is just for the churn of it and has minimal impact on outcomes.[caption id="attachment_1452" align="alignright" width="300"]<a href="http://www.theojones.name/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/8196207581_4c583b3543_o.jpg"><img src="http://www.theojones.name/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/8196207581_4c583b3543_o-300x214.jpg" alt="Image via Flickr user  Pavel P. &lt;a href=" https:>https:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>flic.kr/<wbr></wbr>p/<wbr></wbr>dugGXP</a>" width="300" height="214" class="size-medium wp-image-1452" /&gt; Image via Flickr user  Pavel P.<br /><a href="https://flic.kr/p/dugGXP%5B/caption%5D">https:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>flic.kr/<wbr></wbr>p/<wbr></wbr>dugGXP[/<wbr></wbr>caption]</a> Efficiency to an economist is about maximizing GDP. To a scientist GDP (the sum of all goods and services produced in the economy) is effectively the cost of producing the desired outcomes. As I will discuss  later this is very different from the perspective of some hard line environmentalists who beleive that the economy is over-grown and needs to be pruned down to shape. <a href="http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?EconomicEfficiencyIsNotEngineeringEfficiency">An article describes this difference as follows:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Engineering, a design or process is efficient if it maximizes the amount of work done, while minimizing the resources used (raw materials, time, labor, fuel, etc). An efficient design should do everything it is designed for, and if possible eliminate the need for other devices or processes, while avoiding any unnecessary steps or equipment. Cost is only an issue to the extent that money is itself a resource, and often a limiting one. An important engineering goal is to produce a solution that is lasting; if a product can be maintained indefinitely, and need not be replaced, it is especially esteemed.  <br />In Microeconomics, a company is efficient if it returns the greatest profit in the shortest amount of time, and continues to do so indefinitely. All other considerations are irrelevant; maximizing the bottom line is the only yardstick. This contradicts the Engineering definition in that a sensible manager can and should be ready to throw vast amounts of cheap resources into a project, if it means that greater revenue is made as a result.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When scientists obtain management of an industry material efficiency is generally focused on, while when economists and business types are in charge economic efficiency is emphasized. This has strong implications in many industries. From a strict GDP maximizing perspective the U.S health-care system is quite "efficient", i.e it produces over 15% of the nation's GDP. However, it does not do as well at more tangible measures -- such as improvements in health outcomes. In European health care systems, where scientists have more say in the management of the system the health care system tends to produce less of the GDP (ie. lower economic efficiency), but produces better real world outcomes for fewer resources (ie. better material efficiency). </p>

<p>In the software industry, similar issues come up. The opensource community (which is ran mostly by computer scientists, and software engineers)  tends to favor less profitable development methodologies that reduce profit. For example, the licencing found in this community has vastly more provisions for code reuse. The code is licensed to anyone under terms that allow anyone to make use of it. This ability to reuse reduces the labor required (improved material efficiency), but this also eliminates much of the profit of the companies, and makes it hard to sell the software (reduced economic efficiency).</p>

<p>This focus on material efficiency is very different from the hardline environmentalist "degrowth" perspective. In regards to a material efficiency outlook economic output is not considered a bad, just not something that should be an explicit target. Increased economic growth should be favored when it produces improved real world outcomes.</p>

      <title>Is The Economy Separate From the Political System</title>

<p>In this post I will argue that the economy is fundamentally part of the political system and not some separate thing. By extension I will argue that economics should not be considered a separate field but instead  should be considered as part of the theory of politics and political science. <a href="http://economics.about.com/od/economics-basics/a/What-Is-Economics.htm">Lets start with looking at a common definition of economics. </a>  Emphasis added. [caption id="attachment_1454" align="alignright" width="300"]<a href="http://www.theojones.name/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/4744388119_4afba167a4_o.jpg"><img src="http://www.theojones.name/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/4744388119_4afba167a4_o-300x199.jpg" alt="Image via Flickr user  JD Hancock &lt;a href=" https:>https:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>flic.kr/<wbr></wbr>p/<wbr></wbr>8efeia</a>" width="300" height="199" class="size-medium wp-image-1454" /&gt; Image via Flickr user  JD Hancock<br /><a href="https://flic.kr/p/8efeia%5B/caption%5D">https:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>flic.kr/<wbr></wbr>p/<wbr></wbr>8efeia[/<wbr></wbr>caption]</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Simply, and perhaps surprisingly put,<strong> economics is the study of scarcity</strong>. Resources are limited, and every society wants to figure out how to allocate its resources for maximum benefit. The field of economics serves in large part to help answer this resource allocation question. Economists study topics such as:  <br />How prices and quantities of items are determined in market economies  <br />How much value markets create for society  <br />How taxes and regulation affect economic value  <br />Why some goods and services are under-supplied in a market economy  <br />How firms compete and maximize profit  <br />How households decide what to consume, how much to save, and how much to work (or, more generally, how people respond to incentives)  <br />Why some economies grow faster than others  <br />What effect monetary and fiscal policy has on economic well-being  <br />How interest rates are determined</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This definition argues that the allocation of goods under scarcity is the defining factor of economics, and by extension the difference between the general political system and the economy. However, all institutions work to allocate goods under scarcity. Without scarcity there would be no need for a government and anarchism would be a functioning system. Politics is about scarcity as much as economics. Likewise the examples used in the quoted section all assume some kind of market existing outside of the government and political system. But the market is fundamentally a creature of this system. The government decides how contracts will be made (if you think that there is some kind of natural contract law look at how much this law has varied between societies over history).The government sets the broad outlines of what is sold, it sets the question of who has the authority to make decisions within the businesses in the market. The government sets the outlines of property rights, and determines what can be owned, and how this ownership can be obtained. It creates the currency system. Markets cannot exist in a stable fashion without governments. Governments have shaped every economic intuitions. There is no economy or set of economic institutions that is separate from the political system as a whole. There is no distinction between economics and the study of the political system as a whole.</p>

        <p>This happened: <br /><a href="http://arstechnica.com/business/2014/07/mozilla-confirms-interim-ceo-as-new-top-hire/"></a><a href="http://arstechnica.com/business/2014/07/mozilla-confirms-interim-ceo-as-new-top-hire/">http:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>arstechnica.com/<wbr></wbr>business/<wbr></wbr>2014/<wbr></wbr>07/<wbr></wbr>mozilla-confirms-interim-ceo-as-new-top-hire/<wbr></wbr></a> <br /></p><blockquote>
<p>On Monday, the Mozilla Corporation announced that its last-minute April hire for interim CEO, Chris Beard, has been permanently appointed to the position. Mozilla Executive Chairwoman Mitchell Baker confirmed the news in a blog post, stating that "the board has reviewed many internal and external candidates—and no one we met was a better fit."</p>

<p>Beard's Mozilla tenure began in 2004 and saw him eventually rise to chief innovation and chief marketing officer. He left the company in 2013 to become an "executive in residence" at Greylock Partners, an investment firm with a heavy focus on tech companies. His return to Mozilla in April came on the heels of Brendan Eich's controversial hire to the CEO position, which ended with Eich's resignation that month.</p>
</blockquote><p>Its idiotic to make decisions about the management of a company based on the basis of political stuff that has little to do with the running of the company. Based pretty much on the opinion of people writing flamage on Tumblr, Mozilla replaced one of the founders of the company, a person with wide experience in the firm's core competency -- creating web browsers -- with a marketing type based solely on a donation to a political campaign in 2008. This is utter insanity. I believe that this decision will be a future business school case  study on why it is a good idea to keep personal politics out of the running of a company. The new CEO's current tenure has already shown that he is an inferior candidate. As interim CEO Beard has doubled down on multiple bad decisions by expanding the company's phone project and attempting to enter the computer market by creating a laptop. Beard is attempting to run the company like a regular software company. But the world of open source is different. The open source world already suffers from a high degree of market fragmentation and the actions of the new management of Mozilla will only make matters worse. Beard's decision to add Digital Rights Management systems to the Firefox browser has widely alienated the Linux community. The decision to manafucture a phone puts them in open warfare with many companies with deeper pockets -- particularly Microsoft and Google. It also takes Mozilla far from areas where it has a history of product development. Considering the fact that the Firefox Phone has no user or developer base it has no chance on the market. It is in the same price range as Microsoft's low end phones, and it is also in direct competition with the various Chinese landfill Androids that are on the market. They have simply no serious hope of winning this battle. Their decision to make a Chromebook competitor is similarly boneheaded.  They will be competing with dozens of established computer manufacturers when they have no experience in this area. </p><p><a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/brendaneich" class="p-category" rel="tag">#brendaneich</a> <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/ceo" class="p-category" rel="tag">#ceo</a> <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/digitalrightsmanagement" class="p-category" rel="tag">#digitalrightsmanagement</a> <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/firefoxphone" class="p-category" rel="tag">#firefoxphone</a> <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/old" class="p-category" rel="tag">#old</a> <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/old" class="p-category" rel="tag">#old</a> <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/uncategorized" class="p-category" rel="tag">#uncategorized</a></p></div>]]></description>

<p>I will say that Facebook is pretty loose with the banhammer and bans both conservative and liberal groups for BS reasons. Its moderation policies seem pretty inconsistent from what I've heard, and they rely on automated systems for a lot of it. For some pages, just getting a large number of people reporting a status of yours can get you banned by a computer. But, its a system-wide issue and doesn't seem to be just a thing that targets conservatives.</p>

<p>My solution to this issue would be to <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140403093812/&lt;a%20href=" https:>https:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>theojones.name/<wbr></wbr>index.php/<wbr></wbr>2013/<wbr></wbr>12/<wbr></wbr>30/<wbr></wbr>ideal-distributed-social-networking-application-look-like/<wbr></wbr></a>" title="What Would the Ideal Distributed Social Networking Application Look Like?"&gt;create a decentralized social network. Facebook has complete control over their system and can abuse that control. But social networking systems are generally natural monopolies and therefore different competing networks can not remain in stable competition.</p>

        <p>I don't use standard WYSIWYG type word processors when it is possible to avoid them. Instead I use typesetting systems like LATEX for long documents, and plain ANSI text for shorter documents. This has three huge benefits </p><p>1) Separation between layout and content. With a typesetting program, you just write the text and the program takes care of formatting it. <br />
2)Follows the UNIX philosophy. The LATEX + Typesetting system closely follows the core rule of the UNIX philosophy "<em>This is the Unix philosophy: Write programs that do one thing and do it well. Write programs to work together. Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.</em>" The core of TEX is extremely small and the entire LATEX system is formed out of a set of small scripts that are built upon this. The system is extremely modular and flexible. These programs are driven by the command line. While it is impossible to use a command driven system without first learining it, it gives vast power to the user <br />
3)Flexibility. Due to the modular and flexible nature of LATEX the system can do almost anything. Want to properly format math equations? Sure.  Want to create a circut diagram? There is a package for that? Want to format a book so it is ready to go for Amazon's CreateSpace system?<a href="https://github.com/aginiewicz/createspace"> A package just for that</a> is ready to go. I could name many other examples. This is only made possible by the code driven modular nature of a typesetting type system. <br />
4) Plain text is the universal system. Almost every operating system written since the 70s can edit and view plain text files. LATEX is just a plain text file of markup code.So, anything could view a document written in LATEX. Try that with Libreoffice or MS Word. </p><p>The following article is written by someone with a similar opinion to me on this. It mostly focuses on the layout versus content issue. <br /><a href="http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/~cottrell/wp.html"></a><a href="http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/~cottrell/wp.html">http:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/<wbr></wbr>~cottrell/<wbr></wbr>wp.html</a></p><p><a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/ansi" class="p-category" rel="tag">#ansi</a> <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/latex" class="p-category" rel="tag">#latex</a> <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/old" class="p-category" rel="tag">#old</a> <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/old" class="p-category" rel="tag">#old</a> <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/uncategorized" class="p-category" rel="tag">#uncategorized</a> <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/unix" class="p-category" rel="tag">#unix</a> <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/wysiwyg" class="p-category" rel="tag">#wysiwyg</a></p></div>]]></description>

      <title>Economics and Externalities</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div>
        <p>I will discuss the economics of externalities. An externality is a cost of producing something that is not materialized in the price charged (or any other cost) to a willing participant in that transaction. This is problematic because the cost of a thing is highly tied to the level of demand for it. In general, when the cost of something is lower then people buy more of it. When, in the case of an externality, a large part of the cost of something is on other people then the consumers will bear less than the full cost of that thing and will therefore want to buy more of it than is generally socially desirable. Climate change, of course produces an externality. Because a large number of the costs of fossil fuels are on third parties consumers will buy more of these fuels than is desirable, and favor these fuels over alternatives to an extent that is unmerited. Of course, in the real world things are usually not as simple as a simple case where we can place the full weight of the blame for the externality-producing condition on a single person.Even on the climate change issue we can come up with situations where people other than polluters are to blame for some impacts. Take for instance the case of someone who purchases a house in an area that is becoming increasingly flood prone due to climate change, and is flooded out due to that risk. It it clear that this person experienced an externality due to the greenhouse gas pollution, but it is also arguable that the home-buyer was responsible for part of this harm. Policy makers will have to sort out this type of issue when making climate policy. But despite this objection, the externality model is still a good way to theorize about the effects of climate change. </p><p>The government has multiple ways to adjust individual intensives to deal with externalities problem. It could pass a regulation that bans a externality-producing activity. Or it could pass a tax on the activity. The tax could raise the cost of the activity, thereby bringing its paid cost in line with its true cost. It could do a cap and trade type regulation whereby a limit is set on the amount of the activity allowed, and the permits to do the activity are auctioned off. The government could also subsidize the alternative's to the activity. </p><p>The regulation method is at the core of command and control type responses to climate change. These have the possibility of being relativity egalitarian in their distributional impacts. But they also have the possibility of being the most inefficient. These methods mandate the same abatement methods uniformly, and fail to encourage other resolutions to climate change. Local laws and urban planning changes will have a strong role in mitigating climate change. I also think that governments should pass regulations that commit to the shutdown of polluting industries. Additionally, direct regulation and civil litigation is particularly effective at targeting industries that are in countries that do not have an effective climate policy.  I will discuss the role that I think direct regulation should have in an energy policy in an later post.</p><p>The taxing method in the climate change world is known as a carbon tax. It has the benefit of allowing free consumer choice while still providing for a strong incentive to switch. A tax works by directly increasing the cost of the extenality-producing pollution. This is in order to make the effective cost that consumers face when buying products equal to the real cost of the polluting energy involved. Carbon taxes provide incentive to reduce pollution, while still allowing for individual choice. The huge counter argument to a climate policy that relies on carbon taxes is the fact that they provide no guarantee that the CO2 emissions will fall to their target level. This is problematic because the optimal level of CO2 emissions is effectively zero.</p><p>A related option to a carbon tax is a cap and trade program. In a cap and trade system a finite number of permits to pollute are distributed. This provides a stable emissions reduction at the expense of stability of the price of carbon.  Because they target the level of CO2 emissions, not the price of these emissions they have the benefit of being more responsive to economic conditions. If there is high inflation, the real/effective carbon tax will be reduced because the money used to pay the tax is worth less, but with a cap and trade the price will quickly adjust.  Distributing the permits is also a design issue for cap and trade programs. Many cap and trade programs distribute the credits to firms based on past pollution. I believe that this is generally a bad idea and instead the permits should just be auctioned off. Both cap and trade programs and carbon taxes have potential distributional issues. That is, without any attempt to mitigate their effects they have the potential to effect the poor more than the wealthy. </p><p>Subsidies work by reducing the cost of alternatives to the externalities. In regards the the climate change issue the government can fund investment in  clean energy sources, and in energy conservation methods. The reduction of cost of alternative energies will cause consumers to switch over to them. Subsidies have strong distributional benefits, while still allowing more consumer choice is designed right.However, they can also cause overconsumption of energy. Subsidizes can also include methods such as public works projects that build infrastructure. As I will discuss further in the section on French investment in nuclear energy,  subsidizes have one huge advantage. They can overcome the problems of imperfect information and short term bias in investment. Companies are often under pressure to bring forth a short term profit, and this will often mean that they will forgo long-term investments that will cost more in the short run, but bring longer run benefits. Government subsidy policy can overcome this issue and can be used to encourage the longer term investment. Companies also face a high degree of risk due to their lack of knowledge. Some investments have a high possible return, but a high risk. Because companies can not afford a large loss, they will be risk adverse and will forgo high-risk, high-return investments. Government policy can change this. Imperfect information also bites companies in a different way. The profitability of an investment -- particularly in the energy world -- can strongly depend on what the competitors of a company are doing. There are cases where companies can compete in an mutually destructive way, or an uncoordinated way. Government subsidy policy and indirect planning can provide a way to coordinate the actions of firms. This will improve the efficiency of markets. </p><p>In a more controversial economic note I will discuss my opinions on how inequality effects the efficiency of markets. Of course, there are many economists that would disagree with what I am about to say in this paragraph. Purely market based programs have one Achilles' Heel though. Their economic efficiency is dependent on the assumption that monetary value (the amount of money that someone would give up for a benefit) is equal to the associated change in well being. Economists call this a linear welfare function -- with "welfare" in this circumstance referring to well being. This is a questionable assumption. In reality, the relation between market efficiency in the since that advocates of a market-based solution to global warming discuss, and the real welfare of the populace are often in conflict. This conflict is particularly strong when there is high inequality in the economic system.This economic inequality makes prices into something that depends as much on ability to pay as actual need. I also would argue that all preferences are not equal. An wealthy person's preference to convert grains into biofuels to save money on fuel is of much lower value than the preference of a poor person to eat the grains. In regards to how resources should be distributed, my thinking is along the line of the "difference principle" that has been often discussed in the political philosophy literature -- the well worst off groups in society should be maximized, even if this means reduced over all economic production. This factor means that countries who want to conduct an effective climate change policy will also need to enact anti-poverty measures along with their climate change mitigation policy.  Additionally, because global inequality is even higher than the level of inequality that prevails within nations there will necessarily be a role for command and control regulation, and indirect economic planning through subsidizes. Without these more hands on policies the world's poor will face severe harms from the climate change mitigation policies that should help them. Additionally, the effects that inequality has on market efficiency will mean that a much more rapid climate change policy will be needed than what would be justified by a purely economic cost benefit analysis. In reality a sustainable energy plan would need to use all four of the methods of changing incentives. All of these methods have their benefits in some circumstances. </p><p><a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/achillesheel" class="p-category" rel="tag">#achillesheel</a> <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/old" class="p-category" rel="tag">#old</a> <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/old" class="p-category" rel="tag">#old</a> <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/uncategorized" class="p-category" rel="tag">#uncategorized</a></p></div>]]></description>

        <section class="post-content">
<p><i><a href="https://theojones.name/blog-post-series-on-the-history-of-sustainable-energy-and-climate-change-politics/">This is part of a blog post series on climate change.</a></i><i></i><i>In this post I am using a new way of doing citations that I will use in some of my longer posts. The citations can be found at the end notes/</i>During the interwar period and in World War 2 the German government placed heavy emphasis on fnding ways to synthesize fuel. Most of this research focused around the Fischer-Tropsch process [1, 26-29] and the Bergius process [2]. The Bergius process is able to hydrogenate coal, and other sources of carbon, and turn them into hydrocarbons. The Fischer-Tropsch process is able to synthesize hydrocarbons from carbon monoxide/carbon dioxide and hydrogen, with a input of energy. In the German program the CO2 and the energy came from coal. The Fischer-Tropsch process process was invented by Franz Fischer and Hans Tropsch in the 1920s at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Coal Research. Germany' s frst commercial use of the process came in 1935.German company Ruhrchemie AG saw the process as a way to add value to surplus coal and in 1934 bought the patents for the process. Hitler saw an even more expansive use for the method, German energy independence, and commissioned large scale construction of such plants. By November of 1935 almost 800000 barrels of [1, 26-27]. This production didn't just include fuel, but also included non-fuel oil based products. These include rubber, alcohols, aldehydes, soft waxes and detergents. Coal hydrogenation was the preferred process for producing gasoline and aviation fuel, while the Fischer-Tropsch process was preferred for other fuels [3, 148]. However, the Fischer-Tropsch process is capable of producing either. The production of synthetic oil would turn out tobe critical to the war effort, as Germany has no supply of natural oil. This was part of a massive program to reconstruct German military power, and to promote a mircentilist trade policy. The World War One experience showed the dependence that Germany had of foreign goods. Furthermore, Germany had trouble obtaining the hard currency needed to import natural oil and the nation's government was concerned that global oil supplies could run out (both during the Weimar and Nazi periods). By 1938 of the war Germany was targeting a production of 38 million barrels of these fuels per year however there were some diffculties in actiuly meeting this production goal, and persistent labor shortages during the war. Actual 1938 production was about 10 million barrels, and 1943 production was 36 million barrels [5]. This prewar build-up received substantial investment from foreign firms, particularly American firms. Additionally, U.S firms (which were much more sophisticated at refinning oil) provided some needed technology. A report from the Commercial Attach of the U.S. Embassy in Berlin in 1933 stated "In two gears Germany will be manufacturing oil and gas enough out of soft coal for a long war. The Standard Oil of New York is furnishing millions of dollars to help." A memorandum from IG Farben, a major producter of fuels with the FT process, stated [6]<br />"The closing of an agreement with Standard was necessary for tech nical, commercial, and financial reasons,technically, because the specialized experience which was available only in a big oil company was necessary to the further development of our process, and no such industry existed in Germany; commercially, because in the absence of state economic control in Germany at that time, IG had to avoid a competitive struggle with the great oil powers, who always sold the best gasoline at the lowest price in contested markets; financially, because IG, which had already spent extraordinarily large sums for the development of the process, had to seek financial relief in order to be able to continue development in other new technical fields, such as buna. .... By reason of their decades of work on motor fuels, the Americans were ahead of us in their knowledge of the quality requirements that are called for by the different uses of motor fuels. In particular they had developed, at great expense, a large number of methods of testing gasoline for different uses. On the basis of their experiments they had recognized the good anti, knock quality of iso-octane long before they had any knowledge of our hydrogenation process. This is proved by the single fact that in America fuels are graded in octane numbers, and iso-octane was entered as the best fuel with the number 100. All this knowledge naturally became ours as a result of the agreement, which saved us much effort and protected us against many errors."  /blockquote&gt;<br />Why is the previous discussion in a history of German synthetic fuels during World War 2 relevant to a book on climate change? The Fischer-Tropsch process turns out to be one of the few ways known to produce sustainable fuels. It is a versatile process. The energy source it uses can be almost anything. Modern proposals based around the Fischer-Tropsch process often use nuclear energy or renewable sources  7 . Usually these modern proposals proposals argue for at first using the exhaust from coal plants as the CO2 source, and as these are decommissioned switching to sequestered atmospheric CO2  7 . This CO2 could be collected from an array of land based collecting stations  8  (spaced in a similar way as wind power generators  9 ), or could collect from the more concentrated CO2 in the ocean  10 .  11 . The cost of fuels produced in this fashion would up to $6 a gallon and possibly as low as $3 a gallon with modern techniques  10 .</p>
