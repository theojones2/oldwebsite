<p>Yesterday the U.S Supreme Court announced its decision in <em>Burwell v. Hobby Lobby</em>. The Court ruled that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) mandates that Hobby Lobby and other companies with owners that have religious objections to the federal contraceptive mandate be given an exemption to the mandate. The RFRA is a statute passed in 1993 that requires religious exemptions to a wide range of laws and was passed due to Congressional frustration at the courts' unwillingness to mandate exemptions to neutral laws under the First Amendment. The range of the protections for religious objection provided by RFRA are much broader than what the Constitution requires. The RFRA can be repealed or amended like any other law, and due to the Court's ruling in <em>City of Boerne v. Flores</em> (1997) it only applies to federal regulations, not state laws. A Democratic controlled Congress, and Bill Clinton passed the RFRA despite court rulings that stated that applying such a standard would open a floodgate of litigation and requests for exemptions. In <em>Employment Division v. Smith</em> (1990) the Court rejected the standard eventually imposed by the RFRA saying it would effect laws that include "payment of taxes to health and safety regulation such as manslaughter and child neglect laws, compulsory vaccination laws, drug laws, and traffic laws; to social welfare legislation such as minimum wage laws, child labor laws, animal cruelty laws, environmental protection laws, and laws providing for equality of opportunity for the races" . For reasons I will discuss later I think that the majority opinion is the correct interpretation of the RFRA and of current law. The problems with this ruling are mostly the fault of Congress.  However, I also think that the RFRA should be repealed and I am largely opposed to grants of religious exemptions to neutral laws. I will discuss that problem in a future blog post.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Historically, the Supreme Court has long ruled that while religious exemptions can be added to laws, there is no obligation under the First Amendment to grant such exemptions. The First Amendment requires that members of different religions be allowed to communicate their beliefs, requires that the government refrains from favoring certain religious beliefs, and protects the freedom of believers to associate with others who share their beliefs. However, the religious still have to abide by the same laws as everyone else. The first case where the court found this is in <em>Reynolds v. United States</em> (1878) which upheld a law banning polygamy against a religious freedom based challenge.  It is worth noting that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/15/us/a-utah-law-prohibiting-polygamy-is-weakened.html">a 2013 case before the United States District Court in Utah struck down</a> the same polygamy ban statute on privacy grounds. <em>Reynolds</em> created a solid boundary between belief and action. While it is acceptable for one to have and express a religion, it is not as acceptable to put this belief into action, when that action conflicts with the law. That principle was the law until the Supreme Court broadened its interpretation of the Free Exercise clause to allow for more religious exemption to laws. In <em>Sherbert v. Verner</em> (1963) the court found that it violated the First Amendment when the plaintiff in the case was deprived of unemployment benefits as a result of refusing to accept a job that required work on the Sabbath. In <em>Wisconsin v. Yoder</em> (1972) the Court ruled that Amish parents and children must be exempted from truancy laws when those laws mandate attendance to a school that conflicts with Amish belief. In these cases the court ruled that when someone has <span style="color: #252525;">a sincere religious belief that conflicts with a law and when complying with the law would put a substantial burden on the objector's ability to act on that belief, the government has a strong obligation to grant exemptions to the law. The only times when a exemption does not have to be granted occur when the government has a compelling interest that cannot be fulfilled by lesser means. </span> These rulings soon provoked further litigation that eventually drove the Supreme Court to reconsider its stance on this subject matter. In Employment Division v. Smith (1990) the court finally reversed itself and returned to the policy that religious exemptions are not required. In the majority opinion justice Scalia wrote</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The "compelling government interest" requirement seems benign, because it is familiar from other fields. But using it as the standard that must be met before the government may accord different treatment on the basis of race, see, e.g., Palmore v. Sidoti, or before the government may regulate the content of speech, see, e.g., Sable Communications of California v. FCC, is not remotely comparable to using it for the purpose asserted here. What it produces in those other fields -- equality of treatment, and an unrestricted flow of contending speech -- are constitutional norms; what it would produce here -- a private right to ignore generally applicable laws -- is a constitutional anomaly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later in the opinion he said</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The rule respondents favor would open the prospect of constitutionally required religious exemptions from civic obligations of almost every conceivable kind -- ranging from compulsory military service to the payment of taxes to health and safety regulation such as manslaughter and child neglect laws, compulsory vaccination laws, drug laws, and traffic laws; to social welfare legislation such as minimum wage laws, child labor laws, animal cruelty laws, environmental protection laws, and laws providing for equality of opportunity for the races</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, Congress didn't see the problem and passed the RFRA three years later, finding that "<span style="color: #000000;">laws 'neutral' toward religion may burden religious exercise as surely as laws intended to interfere with religious exercise"</span>. The full text of the RFRA can be found at <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130611205052/&lt;a%20href=" http: rel="in-reply-to" class="u-in-reply-to">http:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>religiousfreedom.lib.virginia.edu/<wbr></wbr>sacred/<wbr></wbr>RFRA1993.html</a>"&gt;<a href="http://religiousfreedom.lib.virginia.edu/sacred/RFRA1993.html" rel="in-reply-to" class="u-in-reply-to">http:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>religiousfreedom.lib.virginia.edu/<wbr></wbr>sacred/<wbr></wbr>RFRA1993.html</a> The core of the law states that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(a) In General: Government shall not substantially burden a person's exercise of religion even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability, except as provided in subsection (b). (b) Exception: Government may substantially burden a person's exercise of religion only if it demonstrates that application of the burden to the person-- (1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest..</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even the application of the word "person" to a corporation such as Hobby Lobby isn't something the Court just came up with. If you object to that <span style="color: #262626;">blame Congress for it.  Even the application of it to corporations is due to the wonderful work of Congress. The Dictionary Act statute at 1 U.S. Code § 1 defines what "person" refers to in legislation in the absence of clarification otherwise, and  the RFRA just said "person" without any clarification otherwise. </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>the words “person” and “whoever” include corporations, companies, associations, firms, partnerships, societies, and joint stock companies, as well as individuals;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, it is worth noting that ultimately the application of religious freedom legislation to a company protects the owners of it. The rights of a company come out of their rights. And the Hobby Lobby company is owned by just a few individuals, all of whom are of uniform opinion on this matter..<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2014/06/30/hobby-lobby-and-the-legal-rights-of-people-organized-as-corporations/"> An editorial in the Washington Post discusses this, and quotes the following passage</a> from Justice Alito's opinion in the Hobby Lobby case.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Congress provided protection for people like the [owners of Hobby Lobby and Conestoga Wood] by employing a familiar legal fiction: It included corporations within RFRA’s definition of “persons.” But it is important to keep in mind that the purpose of this fiction is to provide protection for human beings. A corporation is simply a form of organization used by human beings to achieve desired ends. An established body of law specifies the rights and obligations of the people(including shareholders, officers, and employees) who are associated with a corporation in one way or another. When rights, whether constitutional or statutory, are extended to corporations, the purpose is to protect the rights of these people. For example, extending Fourth Amendment protection to corporations protects the privacy interests of employees and others associated with the company. Protecting corporations from government seizure of their property without just compensation protects all those who have a stake in the corporations’ financial well-being. And protecting the free-exercise rights of corporations like Hobby Lobby, Conestoga, and Mardel protects the religious liberty of the humans who own and control those companies….</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now that it has been established that a firm like Hobby Lobby can claim religious freedom rights under the RFRA, now lets see why the RFRA mandates religious exemptions to the mandate. To win the case Hobby Lobby at the least has to prove two things.</p>
<ol><li>That its owners have a sincere religious belief that conflicts with the mandate. A<span style="color: #262626;">ll that has to be proven is that Hobby Lobby's owners' belief is sincerely held. They don't have to prove that their belief is actually correct.</span></li>
    <li>They have to prove that their ability to exercise  their beliefs are substantially burdened by their beliefs</li>
</ol>
<p>In regards to the first question, the owners of Hobby Lobby claim to believe that using certain forms of contraceptives, or even being complicit in their distribution is immoral. The trial court found no reason to doubt their sincerity in this belief. Much press coverage has though it is absurd that such a indirect connection to the allegedly immoral activity as buying an insurance plan that could be used to acquire contraception, can be the foundation of a RFRA claim. <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2014/06/30/the-religious-freedom-restoration-act-and-complicity-in-sin/">However, the RFRA clearly allows such a claim.</a> As per the terms of that legislation, all that matters is that the owners of Hobby Lobby believe that the law compels them to do an immoral action. If they believe that contributing to someone else's activity is itself immoral, than that is still sufficient.  The conditions for a substantial burden to occur and similarly broad. All that needs to be met is that the owners of the company think that the law compels them to do something that is intolerably sinful.</p>

<p>At this point the government could still salvage its case if it could prove the following two things</p>
<ol><li>There is a compelling government interest involved</li>
    <li>The regulation is the least intrusive legislation possible to meet the interest.</li>
</ol>
<p>The court found that there is a compelling government interest involved. However, there are regulations possible that put less of a burden on the beliefs of the Hobby Lobby owners. The government could for example pay for the contraceptives out of pocket.</p>
