<p>There is a large difference between how scientists/engineers and economists/business leaders about how efficiency in the economy is viewed. Scientists tend to look at efficiency as minimizing the materials and labor needed to reach a tangible outcome (such as an increase in life expectancy, or general well being). I will call this material efficiency  However, economists tend to look at efficiency as maximizing the goods and services produced in the economy -- even if the production is just for the churn of it and has minimal impact on outcomes.[caption id="attachment_1452" align="alignright" width="300"]<a href="http://www.theojones.name/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/8196207581_4c583b3543_o.jpg"><img src="http://www.theojones.name/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/8196207581_4c583b3543_o-300x214.jpg" alt="Image via Flickr user  Pavel P. &lt;a href=" https: rel="in-reply-to" class="u-in-reply-to">https:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>flic.kr/<wbr></wbr>p/<wbr></wbr>dugGXP</a>" width="300" height="214" class="size-medium wp-image-1452" /&gt; Image via Flickr user  Pavel P.<br /><a href="https://flic.kr/p/dugGXP%5B/caption%5D" rel="in-reply-to" class="u-in-reply-to">https:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>flic.kr/<wbr></wbr>p/<wbr></wbr>dugGXP[/<wbr></wbr>caption]</a> Efficiency to an economist is about maximizing GDP. To a scientist GDP (the sum of all goods and services produced in the economy) is effectively the cost of producing the desired outcomes. As I will discuss  later this is very different from the perspective of some hard line environmentalists who beleive that the economy is over-grown and needs to be pruned down to shape. <a href="http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?EconomicEfficiencyIsNotEngineeringEfficiency">An article describes this difference as follows:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Engineering, a design or process is efficient if it maximizes the amount of work done, while minimizing the resources used (raw materials, time, labor, fuel, etc). An efficient design should do everything it is designed for, and if possible eliminate the need for other devices or processes, while avoiding any unnecessary steps or equipment. Cost is only an issue to the extent that money is itself a resource, and often a limiting one. An important engineering goal is to produce a solution that is lasting; if a product can be maintained indefinitely, and need not be replaced, it is especially esteemed.  <br />In Microeconomics, a company is efficient if it returns the greatest profit in the shortest amount of time, and continues to do so indefinitely. All other considerations are irrelevant; maximizing the bottom line is the only yardstick. This contradicts the Engineering definition in that a sensible manager can and should be ready to throw vast amounts of cheap resources into a project, if it means that greater revenue is made as a result.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When scientists obtain management of an industry material efficiency is generally focused on, while when economists and business types are in charge economic efficiency is emphasized. This has strong implications in many industries. From a strict GDP maximizing perspective the U.S health-care system is quite "efficient", i.e it produces over 15% of the nation's GDP. However, it does not do as well at more tangible measures -- such as improvements in health outcomes. In European health care systems, where scientists have more say in the management of the system the health care system tends to produce less of the GDP (ie. lower economic efficiency), but produces better real world outcomes for fewer resources (ie. better material efficiency). </p>

<p>In the software industry, similar issues come up. The opensource community (which is ran mostly by computer scientists, and software engineers)  tends to favor less profitable development methodologies that reduce profit. For example, the licencing found in this community has vastly more provisions for code reuse. The code is licensed to anyone under terms that allow anyone to make use of it. This ability to reuse reduces the labor required (improved material efficiency), but this also eliminates much of the profit of the companies, and makes it hard to sell the software (reduced economic efficiency).</p>

<p>This focus on material efficiency is very different from the hardline environmentalist "degrowth" perspective. In regards to a material efficiency outlook economic output is not considered a bad, just not something that should be an explicit target. Increased economic growth should be favored when it produces improved real world outcomes.</p>
