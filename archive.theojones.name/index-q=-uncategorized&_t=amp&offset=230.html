<p><strong>This blog post is the first in a series where I will explore the science behind climate change, the effects of climate change and solutions to the climate change problem.  </strong></p><p>Earlier this month atmospheric carbon dioxide levels exceeded 400 parts per million for the first time in recorded history, <a href="http://www.skepticalscience.com/pliocene-snapshot.html"> and most likely for the first time in three million years</a>. The evidence is clear that climate change is occurring and that it is a very significant global problem. Global warming is primarily caused by humans and there are policy and economic changes that can reduce it in the future. Ninety-seven percent of climatologists agree with this mainstream view and no scientific body in the natural sciences of international standing disagrees with it.</p><p> As the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found in its most recent assessment, changes to the climate, caused by CO2 and other greenhouse gasses, will create extreme weather patterns,raise sea levels, and decrease sea ice levels. Global temperatures have increased to a level not exceeded for the last 125,000 years. Current changes to the climate will have effects that could last for hundreds of years. If measures are not taken to reduce current emissions levels, significant additional climate change will almost certainly happen.</p><p><a href="http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art32/main.html">A 2009 study found that</a> maintaining a climate and global ecosystem that is fundamentally similar to the one that has existed over the last 10,000 years will require the change in radiative forcing to be limited to 1 watt per square meter-- roughly equivalent to limiting CO2 levels to 350 parts per million. This is compared to current levels of 1.5 watts per square meter and 400 parts per million.The same paper also found that biodiversity loss has already increased to more than 10 times a sustainable or desirable level and found human-caused disruptions to the nitrogen cycle that exceeded what ecosystems can sustain without severe disruption.</p><p>To restore CO2 levels to this sustainable level is possible but will take a massive investment and this investment must start now. However, the fact that CO2 levels were allowed to reach 400 without any urgent climate change mitigation plan in sight shows that we are not currently on a sustainable path and that substantial additional action is needed to prevent a calamity.</p><p><a href="tag/climatechange.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#climatechange</a> <a href="tag/old.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#old</a> <a href="tag/old.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#old</a> <a href="tag/uncategorized.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#uncategorized</a></p></div>                    </div>

<p>Politicians, driven by faulty economic theories and their own political ambitions, are again thinking about taking the nation's reputation hostage and gambling with America's future. Yes, the Republicans seem to be planning another debt ceiling crisis. <a title="According to the Los Angeles Times" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130614000138/%3Ca%20href=" http:>http:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>www.latimes.com/<wbr></wbr>business/<wbr></wbr>la-fi-debt-limit-20130510,0,7705505.story</a>" target="_blank"&gt;According to the Los Angeles Times, the party's legislators want "tangible progress on overhauling the tax code" in return for a debt ceiling increase.</p>

<p>The debt ceiling limits the the number of government bonds that can be issued. Although a debt ceiling increase does not authorize additional spending, under current government practice, debt issue is needed to meet commitments already made by Congress. If the debt ceiling is not raised, the United States government will default on obligations committed to by existing law. The U.S Treasury would not be able to make payments on all government liabilities and programs, or would have to resort to unconventional means to fund the government deficit. Many major government programs would necessarily face rapid cuts. The economic consequences of such a default could be disastrous. Let's first look at what would have happened if the debt limit was not increased during the 2011 crisis. <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2011/02/17/news/economy/debt_limit_spending_cuts/index.htm?iid=EL" target="_blank">According to CNN</a>, the cuts required would have been equivalent to the any of the following: the amount spent on “all discretionary spending, including defense,” plus 50 billion dollars; 70 percent of the funds spent on Social Security or Medicare; or two-thirds of total government tax revenue.Additional cuts would have been needed to cover the government through 2012, or to account for the effect that depressed private spending would have had on the economy. Clearly, suddenly disbanding the military or ending Social Security would not be good policy. But unrealistic budget slashing of that magnitude is proposed when the Tea Party demands that their ideology rule the day, regardless of whether it's supported by sound economic theory or the majority of the nation's voters.<br />If the debt ceiling is not raised this year, the program cuts made necessary by this inaction will be very harsh. Budget reductions amounting to between four to five percent of GDP, or about one-half of those that would have been required during the 2011 crisis, will be necessary. Obviously, this would be very harmful. The decreases in government spending that would be required would also immediately reduce economic output. This is because decreases in government spending will directly reduce demand for products. The possible supply of goods and services in the current depressed economy is substantially greater than the demand for these goods. Therefore, an increase in demand will increase economic production in the current situation because businesses will have the capacity to absorb it. But if the debt ceiling isn't raised, just the opposite will happen. Demand and output will be reduced by a decrease in government spending because less money will be around to purchase American products. Government contracts with businesses may be canceled or the amount spent decreased. Benefit reductions will also lessen demand for goods and services. If food stamp benefits are reduced, grocery purchases will decrease. Social Security and unemployment benefit recipients are all buyers of goods and services. With less money, they too will buy less.<br />In fact, the cuts can be expected to reduce demand more than just their raw value. And they would disproportionately harm the poor and middle class, who spend most of their income and have low rates of savings. One person's spending is another's income. Government programs like food stamps and unemployment benefits are extremely good at stimulating demand. <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/18958475" target="_blank">According to an article published in The Economist</a>, “When Moody’s Analytics assessed different forms of stimulus, it found that food stamps were the most effective, increasing economic activity by $1.73 for every dollar spent. Unemployment insurance came in second, at $1.62, whereas most tax cuts yielded a dollar or less.”<br />Failing to raise the debt ceiling would hurt the U.S. government and the economy in one other way that is even more detrimental than the effects of budget reductions. A default on government obligations would cause serious harm. A default would occur if the government failed to pay past commitments made by Congress. If the debt ceiling is not raised, the president and the treasury will be obligated to violate at least one law, either a law allocating funds to a government program, or the debt ceiling law itself. As the Supreme Court ruled in Train v. City of New York (1975), the treasury is obligated to disburse all funds allocated by Congress. The cuts made in this fashion will be made without public debate and will not be made through the regular political process. They will be made by orders made by executive branch officials. The ability for the public to debate and contest such cuts is limited and great legislative power–the ability to dissolve or dramatically reduce programs enacted by Congress– would be transferred to the executive.<br />The procedure to avoid default is simple. All Congress has to do is pass a debt ceiling extension. Debt ceiling raises have not been such intense issues in the past. <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2011/01/03/news/economy/debt_ceiling_faqs/index.htm" target="_blank">The debt ceiling has been raised 74 times since March 1962, before it became a major political issue</a>.All that is needed to avoid an economic crisis is a return to this previous pattern where debt ceiling votes are not held up as political tools.<br />This latest game from the Republican Party is just a simple shakedown that lacks even a superficial connection to fixing the debt. Instead of budget cuts, or a budget program, what is being demanded are changes to the fundamental structure of tax policy. The tax reform proposals supported by the Republicans will not reduce the debt, just change the distributional effects of the tax code in a way that benefits the wealthy. In fact, a majority of Republicans have signed a no-tax-increase pledge. Those truly concerned about the deficit would not be proposing tax cuts that would reduce government revenue.<br />Why not eliminate the deficit? A deficit is necessary at many times for two reasons. The first is that when the economy is below full-employment, government deficit spending is often the only way to restore the economy. The second is that <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/johntharvey/2012/07/18/why-you-should-love-government-deficits/" target="_blank">a government surplus necessarily means a private sector that is as a whole running a deficit</a>. By accounting identity, net (domestic) private savings equals the sum of the government deficit and the trade balance (positive if a trade surplus, negative if a trade deficit).The only way that the U.S government can be in surplus when there is a trade deficit is if, on average, households and domestic businesses are in deficit. Large private debts are inherently more harmful than government debts because households and businesses have finances that are much more constrained than the finances of the government.<br />Republicans have learned that shakedowns like this work because Obama has folded before. The majority of the Republican party has also been cowed by the risk of a primary challenge from the <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/127181/tea-partiers-fairly-mainstream-demographics.aspx" target="_blank">28 percent of the population that supports the extremists of the Tea Party</a>. It is high time that we stop this small minority from setting the nation's agenda. The fact that the Tea Party, and its supporters, want to risk irreparable, long-term damage to the nation to achieve short-term political goals makes such an extreme political movement unfit to govern.</p>

<p>The Second Amendment does not forbid moderate gun regulations. While there is an individual right to keep and bear arms, both the history behind the Amendment and current legal interpretation does not make this right as broad and as absolute as freedom of speech and other civil liberties. This is because the Second Amendment created an individual right in order to serve a collective purpose. The framers of the constitution believed that an armed populace in near universal militia service was a vehicle to protect individual rights. While there is a right for individuals to keep and bear arms, some limits on this right are within the government's power.</p>

<p>The framers of the United States Bill of Rights planned a military system based around broad based service where most adult males were expected to serve in a militia. Gun ownership was to be part of this militia system. Individuals would keep their personal military weapon but be expected to participate in and be trained as part of the military service. This tying of national service and gun ownership created a system where gun ownership was common but not necessarily restriction free. The intent of the founders was to create a military and gun ownership system that would of been similar to the current Swiss system. The framers of the U.S Constitution were not uniformly opposed to standing armies, but believed that they were potentially dangerous and one way of containing this danger was universal service in militias and a therefore more limited standing army. In the founders' view a large militia with broad based service supplemented by a smaller standing army was the optimal military and the one best suited to preserve liberty. Additionally, the founders also viewed individual gun ownership outside of a militia as important to the public interest and as a necessary supplement to militia service.</p>

<p>The militia clause of the Amendment states the purpose of the Second Amendment but the "right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed" clause of the Amendment is the effective part of the amendment. The Amendment provided that "right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed" because an armed population and a "regulated militia" is "necessary to the security of a free state".</p>

<p>This history and the wording of the Second Amendment create make both the collective right view and the individual rights view of the Amendment partiality correct. But both views are too extreme and contain severe flaws. The Second Amendment created an individual right in order to serve a collective purpose. In the mind of the framers of the U.S Constitution an armed populace in near universal militia service was a vehicle to protect individual rights. Contrary to the collective rights view promoted by many gun control advocates there is an individual right to keep and bear arms. However, the pure individual rights view promoted by groups such as the National Rifle Association is also incorrect as many restrictions are permissible because wide spread gun ownership was viewed as a means to protect liberty and not a fundamental liberty in itself.</p>

<p>While there is a right for individuals to keep and bear arms, some limits on this right are within the government's power because the individual right portion of the Amendment can not be interpreted so broadly as to harm the public interest. The individual right to keep and bear arms should not be interpreted to provide an absolute right akin to freedom of speech or freedom of religion but should be instead interpreted to provide a weaker right.</p>

<p>Alexander Hamilton in <i>Federalist No. 29</i> explained both the utility of an nationally organized militia and how the formation of a militia relates to the general armament of the population (emphasis added).</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>It requires no skill in the science of war to discern that uniformity in the organization and discipline of the militia would be attended with the most beneficial effects, whenever they were called into service for the public defense. …. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">This desirable uniformity can only be accomplished by confiding the regulation of the militia to the direction of the national authority. ....<br /></span><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Little more can reasonably be aimed at with the respect to the people at large than to have them properly armed and equipped ; and in order to see that this be not neglected, it will be necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course of a year.</span></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However,in the Founders' view bearing arms had utility to the public outside just militia service. An armed population, especially one with high militia service created a decentralize way to protect liberty and to prevent the formation of an authoritarian regime. James Madison in Federalist No. 46 wrote</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Besides the advantage of being armed, which the Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation, the existence of subordinate governments,to which the people are attached, forms a barrier against the enterprises of ambition, more insurmountable than any which a simple government of any form can admit of. Notwithstanding the military establishments in the several kingdoms of Europe, which are carried as far as the public resources will bear, the governments are afraid to trust the people with arms. And it is not certain, that with this aid alone they would not be able to shake off their yokes. But were the people to possess the additional advantages of local governments chosen by themselves, who could collect the national will and direct the national force, and of officers appointed out of the militia, by these governments, and attached both to them and to the militia, it may be affirmed with the greatest assurance, that the throne of every tyranny in Europe would be speedily overturned in spite of the legions which surround it.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>While the second amendment protects individual gun ownership and prevents a complete gun ban , the rationale for protecting individual gun ownership is one based on protecting the collective interest. The Constitution does not forbid reasonable and necessary restrictions on the sale and distribution of firearms. This is consistent with current court rulings, which state that there is an individual right to keep and bear arms but allow for substantial limits on that right. The Supreme Court in the majority opinion in <i>District of Colombia vs Heller </i><i>(2008)</i> stated that</p>

<p>300,000, 13,000, and 893. These three numbers will help you understand why global warming and our nation's fossil fuel dependency are grave issues that merit immediate attention.</p>

<p>300,000 represents the number of people who die each year due to the effects of global warming,<a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/europe/05/29/annan.climate.change.human/"> according to a study by the Global Humanitarian Forum</a>, a think tank headed by former United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan. Of those 300,000 deaths, 90 percent were due to malnutrition and disease caused by environmental degradation in developing nations. Additional deaths were caused by weather-related disasters.</p>

<p>300,000 is the number of Americans who die each year due to particle pollution from power plants, according to <a href="http://www.lung.org/about-us/our-impact/top-stories/toxic-air-coal-fired-power-plants.html"> a study by the American Lung Association.</a> That same study also found that "Coal-fired power plants that sell electricity to the grid produce more hazardous air pollution in the U.S. than any other industrial pollution sources".</p>

<p><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20120718072711/%3Ca%20href=" http:>http:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>mediakit.motherjones.com:80/<wbr></wbr>blue-marble/<wbr></wbr>2011/<wbr></wbr>08/<wbr></wbr>carbon-dioxide-emissions-cost-economy-underestimated</a>"&gt;$893 is the economic damage that each ton of emitted carbon dioxide causes.The total cost of the damage done by all CO2 pollution that the average American produces in a year is almost $15,000 (the per capita CO2 emissions of the United States is 17.5 tons).</p>

<p>Polluting industries, such coal, oil and gas, make their profits by not cleaning up the messes they make. They are profitable only because they are not paying the full costs of doing business and instead are placing those costs on the public.Natural resources are never free and they are not limitless. By destroying them now we are depriving future generations of their use and placing the costs of their depletion elsewhere.</p>

<p>Global warming is real and the damage it causes is already devastating to people throughout the world and to the world economy. We have an ethical obligation to rapidly reduce CO2 emissions now and move our economy towards sustainability and alternative energy sources.A full presentation of the scientific evidence for global warming is out of the scope of this blog post, but if you're interested, see this article for a basic overview <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20150325153156/%3Ca%20href=" http:>http:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>physics.ucsd.edu/<wbr></wbr>do-the-math/<wbr></wbr>2011/<wbr></wbr>08/<wbr></wbr>recipe-for-climate-change/<wbr></wbr></a>"&gt;<a href="http://physics.ucsd.edu/do-the-math/2011/08/recipe-for-climate-change/">http:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>physics.ucsd.edu/<wbr></wbr>do-the-math/<wbr></wbr>2011/<wbr></wbr>08/<wbr></wbr>recipe-for-climate-change/<wbr></wbr></a> and this website for rebuttals for common denialist arguments <a href="-a%20href=.html" http:>http:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>www.skepticalscience.com/<wbr></wbr>argument.php</a>"&gt;<a href="http://www.skepticalscience.com/argument.php">http:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>www.skepticalscience.com/<wbr></wbr>argument.php</a> Even if you are a global warming denialist, the fact is we are starting to run out of oil and high-grade deposits of coal and natural gas.<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20150630144808/%3Ca%20href=" http:>http:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>physics.ucsd.edu/<wbr></wbr>do-the-math/<wbr></wbr>2011/<wbr></wbr>10/<wbr></wbr>the-energy-trap/<wbr></wbr></a>"&gt;If we wait until there are dire shortages of energy resources, it will be more difficult to make the switch to alternative energy sources.</p>

<p>Unaddressed global warming will amount to to the mass violation of the human rights of tens of millions of people.Through no fault of their own whole populations will be exposed to health risks, food shortages, increased poverty and damage to their property. Coastal communities will be threatened with destruction as water levels rise. As Penn State professor Donald A. Brown stated "inadequate climate change policies must be understood to trigger human rights violations because climate change will not only make human dignity impossible for tens of millions of people around the world, including countless members of future generations, but directly threaten life itself and resources necessary to sustain life. That is, inadequate climate change policies qualify as human rights violations because of the enormity of harm to life, health, food, property, and inviolability of the right to enjoy the places where people live."(<a href="http://rockblogs.psu.edu/climate/2010/09/ethical-problems-with-cost-arguments-against-climate-change-policies-increased-costs-may-not-justify.html"></a><a href="http://rockblogs.psu.edu/climate/2010/09/ethical-problems-with-cost-arguments-against-climate-change-policies-increased-costs-may-not-justify.html">http:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>rockblogs.psu.edu/<wbr></wbr>climate/<wbr></wbr>2010/<wbr></wbr>09/<wbr></wbr>ethical-problems-with-cost-arguments-against-climate-change-policies-increased-costs-may-not-justify.html</a>) If the United States government did not take appropriate and rapid actions to reduce greenhouse gas pollution it would be a default on the principles set out under treaties including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</p>

<p>High CO2 fuels also come with high costs to national security. According to <a href="http://www.iags.org/costofoil.html"> a report published by the Institute for the Analysis of Global Security “the economic penalties of America's oil dependence total $297.2 to $304.9 billion annually”</a><a>. Most of those costs of importing oil come from the military and political instability the oil trade creates and exposes the United States to. Our oil dependence also exposes the United States to price manipulation by the few major oil producers. An example of this risk came in</a><a href="http://www.setamericafree.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=20&amp;Itemid=2#1"> "1973 when, in response to the Yom Kippur War, OPEC slashed production by 4.3 million barrels a day and caused a four-fold increase in oil prices"</a><a>.</a><a href="https://theojones.name/index.php/global-warming-is-leathal" rel="attachment wp-att-30"> That oil price shock was a primary trigger of the stagflation of the 1970s.</a></p>

<p>Phasing out fossil fuels will have minimal costs. A <a href="http://www.google.org/energyinnovation/growth.html"> study funded by Google found </a> that in their model investment in low CO2 energy sources "added $155 billion per year in GDP, creating 1.1 million net jobs, while reducing household energy costs by $942 per year". That study also found that "a mere five year delay in starting aggressive cost curves could cost the economy an aggregate $2.3-3.2 trillion in unrealized GDP gains, 1.2-1.4 million net jobs, and 8-28 gigatons in avoided greenhouse gas emissions by 2050".</p>

<p>Global warming will become a severe economic and human rights issue if rapid attempts to reduce fossil fuel use are not made. We have a ethical obligation to reduce CO2.</p>

<p>Today, many people in our nation face decisions like these:"<em>Should I pay for my children to go to the doctor or should I pay the rent?</em>" "<em>Should I put food on the table or pay my mortgage?</em>" Poverty shouldn't be an issue in our country. Nobody should have to face these decisions. We are better than that. We are the richest nation in the world. There is sufficient wealth in the United States to eliminate poverty. We have taken the path of inaction when all Western European and Scandinavian nations have for decades tried to eliminate and alleviate the suffering of the poor. They have made great strides in doing so, while still keeping strong economies. But the U.S. has stood still, letting poverty deprive millions of access to basic rights such as food, shelter, health care, and a chance for a productive life. The United States must take action.In this post I will explain why we have a obligation to help the poor and why current government programs are not up to the task of alleviating poverty.When you think of someone that is in poverty you might think of someone that is lazy and never does any work . But this is not true. Millions of those in poverty are the working poor that currently have a job. Many others are unemployed while they try to find a job. According to <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_22/b3885001_mz001.htm">an article in Business Week magazine</a>, 24 percent of the workforce is in poverty.A <a href="http://www.urban.org/publications/310291.html">study by the Urban Institute</a> found that over 44 percent of homeless persons surveyed said they have worked at a job during the week that they were polled. A study by the Department of Health and Human Services <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070510103756/%3Ca%20href=" http:>http:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>www.nrchmi.samhsa.gov/<wbr></wbr>facts/<wbr></wbr>facts_question_2.asp</a>"&gt;found that 23 percent of the homeless are veterans. According to the National Coalition for the Homeless, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20141229123239/%3Ca%20href=" http:>http:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>www.nationalhomeless.org/<wbr></wbr>factsheets/<wbr></wbr>who.html</a>"&gt;39 percent of those that are currently homeless are in families with children.rnrnPoverty prevents many people from becoming the productive citizens that they would otherwise become. Someone will not pursue their higher goals, like getting an education or other job training, if their basic needs are not met.Our Declaration of Independence states that. We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.But to realize these rights we must guarantee that people have a degree of equality of opportunity and their basic needs for food and shelter are met. This is especially true for children who are just starting out and who must rely on their parents.If we want to realize the principles of the Declaration of Independence, we must try our best to give everyone the same chance at a successful life. We must try our best to eliminate the cycle of poverty. We must try our best to allow everyone to get a good education, to receive health care, to get a decent job, to enjoy the same opportunities that all others enjoy. Poverty in childhood comes close to setting how far someone will go in their life. Poverty is the ultimate source of inequality in a modern democracy like the U.S.Alleviating poverty will not hurt the economy. Instead it will improve the economy. To see this, just look at the economies of the social democracies such as Sweden, Finland, Norway and Denmark. These countries tend to have even greater economic prosperity then the United States, without much of the poverty seen all too often in the U.S.Norway , Iceland, Canada, Sweden, and France, all countries with larger welfare systems then the United States, have higher Human Development Index scores then the U.S., according to the United Nations Development Program. The Human Development Index is a measure of the well-being of the population based on per capita GDP, life expectancy and education level.We are country that prides itself on the American Dream. But, the U.S has the second lowest income mobility of any developed nation (only the income mobility of the United Kingdom is worse). In other words "<a href="http://www.freakonomics.com/2012/01/19/is-higher-income-inequality-associated-with-lower-intergenerational-mobility/">rich parents have rich kids and poor parents have poor kids</a>".rnrnAccording to an ABC News report, which cited a study released in November 2009 in the Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory?id=8977934">almost half of the children in the United States will be on food stamps at some point during their childhood</a>. The cost of a home continues to decrease with our current economic depression. Yet many people still can't afford a home. We have almost 500,000 homeless in the U.S. at any given time and <a href="http://www.nationalhomeless.org/factsheets/How_Many.html">at some point in a typical year there will be 3.5 million people</a> that experience homelessness according to the National Coalition for the Homeless .rnrnEvery welfare program that we currently have leaves many behind. For example, look at Medicaid. It has done much to provide healthcare to the poor but does nothing for the 17% percent of the population that a Gallup survey published in 2012 found is uninsured. These people earn too little to buy insurance, but earn too much to qualify for our current welfare programs.The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which is commonly known as the food stamp program, has a similar problem. This program helps many people, but still millions of people have to worry about putting food on the table.According to the Food Research and Action Center, 49.1 million people in the United States live in food insecure households.Public housing programs, such as the Housing Choice Voucher program, that provide aid to families to help them rent a house, haven't eliminated homelessness.Our welfare programs leave millions behind. We need new programs that will help those that fall through the current welfare safety net, particularly the working poor. We have an ethical obligation to help those who are currently in poverty. Everyone deserves a basic standard of living and everyone should have equality of opportunity. We need to make sure everyone has the human rights outlined by our Declaration of Independence. Millions of the poor have been denied equality of opportunity by being born to impoverished parents. They have been denied the basic right to food, shelter, health care and a chance for a productive life.</p>

<p>Last week, in a dangerously misguided decision, North Carolina voters passed a referendum banning gay marriage. In a freedom loving country this referendum makes no sense because gay marriage is simply a matter of preserving and extending liberty and equality to all. Anti-gay marriage advocates are often (if not usually) motivated by either severely misguided and false stereotypes and/or a desire to force everyone to conform to their conservative religious code of morality. Gay marriage bans are unjust infringements on the rights and freedoms of gay Americans. These bans violate the Equal Protection Clause found in the 14<sup>th</sup> Amendment to the U.S Constitution and deprive a large group of liberties protected by the Constitution. There's no justification for current bans on gay marriage.</p>

<p><a name="__DdeLink__0_472281813"></a> Marriage licenses provide many important legal benefits. A 2004 study by the United States General Accounting Office found that 1,138 federal laws use marital status as a factor in determining or receiving benefits, rights, and privileges. According to the Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance (OCRT), <a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/aboutus.htm">a nonsectarian group that</a> "<em>that promotes the freedom of individuals to follow the religious path of their choosing, without discrimination or oppression</em>", <a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/hom_marr.htm">these include benefits</a> to individuals that affect their "<em>Social Security, Medicare, medical leave, and other benefits; property inheritance; the right to visit their spouse in hospital, and make medical decisions if they are incapacitated; security of the couple and of their children</em>". This means gay couples lack the financial security of married couples and the right to have their partner involved in critical decisions if they become incapacitated.</p>

<p>The liberty and well-being of gays is also threatened by the hostility they face. A <a href="http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/resources/policy/ohio-marriage.aspx">statement issued by the American Psychological Association</a> notes that "<em>Taken together, the evidence clearly supports the position that the social stigma, prejudice, discrimination, and violence associated with not having a heterosexual sexual orientation and the hostile and stressful social environments created thereby adversely affect the psychological, physical, social, and economic well-being of lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals.</em>" Bans on gay marriage reinforce these stereotypes and contribute to discrimination against gay couples. These stereotypes, in turn, sometimes lead to bullying, harassment, and even violence against gays and gay couples.</p>

<p><a name="__DdeLink__8_472281813"></a><a name="__DdeLink__10_472281813"></a> The Declaration of Independence says, "<em>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness</em>". If you believe in this principle, as I do, you must conclude that everyone should be entitled to liberty and equality and that freedom should be limited only insofar as is required for everyone else to enjoy liberty.</p>

<p>Conservatives advocating bans on gay marriage cannot show they will be harmed in any way by gay marriages. Many conservatives argue that permitting gay marriage will be corrosive to families and society. However, there is a great body of evidence that contradicts this assertion. A <a href="http://www.aaanet.org/issues/policy-advocacy/Statement-on-Marriage-and-the-Family.cfm">statement issued by the American Anthropological Association</a> states that "<em>The results of more than a century of anthropological research on households, kinship relationships, and families, across cultures and through time, provide no support whatsoever for the view that either civilization or viable social orders depend upon marriage as an exclusively heterosexual institution …..a vast array of family types, including families built upon same-sex partnerships, can contribute to stable and humane societies</em>". I ask those conservatives who reject the vision of liberty for all including gay couples and those turning to religious dogma to consider is the Bible really a good guide for governance? Slavery, stoning, executing whole families for the crimes of one member, mass murder and genocide are <a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/imm_bibl.htm">all found in the Bible</a>. Are religious ideologues asking the government to enforce a biblical version of Sharia law?</p>

<p><a name="__DdeLink__140_472281813"></a><a name="__DdeLink__144_472281813"></a><a name="__DdeLink__146_472281813"></a> Gay marriage bans violate the Equal Protection Clause in the 14<sup>th</sup> Amendment, which reads "<em>No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.</em>" It's clear that gay marriage bans subject a group to unequal treatment. Discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender discrimination are both very similar, so courts should use the same standard to evaluate both. In <em>Craig v. Boren</em> (1976) the Supreme Court ruled gender discrimination is not permissiable unless it furthers an important government interest in a way that is substantially related to that interest. Some conservatives have tried to claim that the important government interest being promoted is the government's interest in promoting procreation through well structured marriage laws. While the government <em><span class="c1">may</span></em> have an important interest in maintaining population growth, gay marriage bans are not substantially related to that interest. Gay marriages wouldn't have a negative affect on heterosexual marriages. And gay marriage bans don't guarantee that the institution of marriage will remain strong. Marriage laws clearly have functions other than to encourage procreation. We don't require every married couple to have children. Along with the equal protection issues, laws that limit interstate recognition of gay marriages, such as the Defense of Marriage Act ,contradict the requirement in Article 4 of the Constitution that "<em>full faith and credit shall be given in each state to the public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of every other state</em>".</p>

<p>Gay marriage prohibitions are just wrong. There's no reality-based justification for discriminatory laws such as the the one passed in the North Carolina referendum. Opposition to gay marriage is fueled by religious fundamentalism and demagoguery from conservative political leaders. It is past time to repeal the wrongheaded and unconstitutional prohibitions of gay marriage that infringe the liberties of millions of people throughout America. If you love freedom, it's the right thing to do.</p>
