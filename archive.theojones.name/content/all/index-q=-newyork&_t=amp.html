A victim of the virus shopped there while infected but asymptomatic (and therefore non-contagious). [caption id="attachment_1443" align="alignright" width="300"]<a href="../../wp-content/uploads/2015/01/2537685236_0eb9a6c92f_o.jpg.html"><amp-img src="http://www.theojones.name/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/2537685236_0eb9a6c92f_o-300x138.jpg" alt="Image via CDC." width="300" height="138" class="size-medium wp-image-1443"></a> Image via CDC.[/caption]The store replaced its inventory and conducted an intensive cleaning and when it reopened after the cleaning it had the support of a number of local officials. However, the fact that there was no reasonable threat to the public didn't stop people from avoiding the store because of its Ebola "connection". The sales of the store halved after the re-opening. This store is a victim of a public that does not understand basic science. It is the victim  of irrational paranoia over an extremely rare virus. A basic understand of the facts of medicine would give a typical individual little to fear in such a situation. Only two people have caught the virus in the United States and the clear facts of the biology of the virus show that the infected individual was not contagious. The fact that irrational parinoa destroyed that small business is outrageous.</p>

<p>Vermont passed a law requiring the labeling of GMO products a few months ago. The law won't take effect until 2016, but there is already litigation about the constitutionality of the legislation. In this post I will argue that the labeling law most likely violates the protections of the First Amendment. Due to the <a href="http://hstlj.org/articles/a-brief-history-of-the-commercial-speech-doctrine-with-some-implications-for-tobacco-regulation/">commercial speech doctrine</a> courts have ruled that advertising (including product labeling) is protected by the Constitution, although to a lesser extent than other forms of speech. The courts have not precisely delineated a boundary for when law makers can regulate commercial speech, but have generally found that</p>

<p>there must be a provable harm (or at least possible harm) to the consumer. Courts have given little weight to subjective consumer preferences, leaving the fulfillment of those to the market. There are some trends in the major Supreme Court cases on the subject such as <em>Virginia State Board of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council</em>, and <em>Central Hudson Gas v. Public Service Commission of New York</em></p>
<ol><li>The general standard for commercial speech cases is intermediate scrutiny. This also is the standard that applies to time place and manner speech restrictions (like city noise laws), sex/gender discrimination( among other protected classes).To pass this standard a law must further important government interest in a way that is substantially related to that interest</li>
    <li>Lawmakers have broad power to ban false advertising and advertising for illegal products.</li>
    <li>Advertising over electronic media receives lower protection than adverting in traditional publications.</li>
    <li>Prior restraint is permissible in the realm of commercial speech</li>
    <li>There is a wide scope for disclosure regulations, but there still needs to be a substantial government interest involved. Justifications based on consumer choice in the absence of tangible harm are usually not sufficient.</li>
</ol>
<p>The most similar case to the GMO one is <em>International Dairy Foods Association v. Amestoy</em> which came before the Second Circuit. This case involved a Vermont labeling law mandating that dairy products produced by cows treated with the rBST hormone be labeled. The government made no claims of a safety risk before the court, and the plaintiffs in that case entered evidence indicating that there was no safety risk. The trial court opinion noted that the government “does not claim that health or safety concerns prompted the passage of the Vermont Labeling Law,” and that there defense is based around "strong consumer interest and the public's ‘right to know’". The Second Circuit found that this interest in consumer choice is not a substantial interest. There may have been animal welfare justifications for the law made in the public discourse, but neither side made such arguments before the court, so that issue was never considered. However, a consumer survey was entered as evidence that indicated that such issues were a reason why consumers may have wanted to avoid rBST products, but none of these responces ammounted to a full argument on this basis (other than noting that the cows were “Producing enough milk already.”) The court found that the most common consumer reasons included</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>(1) They consider the use of a genetically-engineered hormone in the production unnatural;  (2) they believe that use of the hormone will result in increased milk production and lower milk prices, thereby hurting small dairy farmers;  (3) they believe that the use of rBST is harmful to cows and potentially harmful to humans;  and, (4) they feel that there is a lack of knowledge regarding the long-term effects of rBST.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The situation with GMO labeling is even less favorable. There are no reasonable safety arguments that could be used against GMO products. As the GMO products targeted are plants there are not any animal welfare arguments either. This leaves the consumer choice argument, which courts have already rejected as problematic. Allowing abstract preferences that have no basis in fact into the law produces severely paradoxical results when used to justify limits on fundamental rights. Imagine if such preferences were allowed into the other areas of law where the intermediate scrutiny standard was used. The results would be clearly unacceptable. Satisfying subjective consumer preferences in an efficient way are what markets are good at. If there is a consumer demand for notice about GMO products, then a voluntary (and perhaps privately owned) certification system should serve the purpose (with the producers paying the full cost of maintaining the system through fees).</p>

<p>[caption id="attachment_317" align="alignright" width="203"] Unveiling of the Statue of Liberty Enlightening the World (1886) by Edward Moran[/caption]</p>

<p>What are the values that have made America and Americans different? An American can be of any race, creed, religion, philosophy, or ethnicity. The United States has never been a country of one religious or ethnic group, and Americans have many diverse political philosophies. The ideal of America has been that of a country where immigrants from throughout the world could come and make a good life and where Americans from all socioeconomic backgrounds could move up the economic ladder, or at the least attain a good education and provide for themselves and their families if they work hard. America has always been a melting pot and a nation of diversity. America is a home for persons of all types­­ there is no one stereotypical real American.</p>

<p>Americans enjoy freedom of speech and religion and live under a legal system that protects these basic individual rights. What makes a real American is the strong belief in these values and the freedoms that come with being a citizen of the United States, as well as respect for those values and freedoms. The United States was founded to be a country where the most famous lines of the Declaration of Independence -- a document ratified 237 years ago today -- ring true, where “<em>We hold these truths to be self­ evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.</em>”</p>
<div title="Page 1">
<p>America was founded to be a nation of laws, not men, where there would never be a European­style aristocracy and where all were equal in rights and opportunity. These values are inherently both communal and individual as both liberty and equality involve the relations between individuals to other individuals in society. Because of this, the power of community has been at the heart of what makes America great. While these values and hopes have never been fully implemented, and there are still great inequities in American society, these values form the heart and soul of America and its people.</p>
<div title="Page 1">
<p>The fact that America is a nation of diversity can be seen in where Americans have come from. There have been Americans that have come from almost all cultural groups in the world.</p>
<div title="Page 2">
<p>Starting even before independence, America has been a melting pot of immigrants of different cultures and religions. British Puritans and Pilgrims migrated to the New World for religious liberty and settled in New England and founded the colonies of Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Connecticut. Quaker immigrants settled Pennsylvania looking for religious freedom. Pennsylvania after Quaker settlement was the first colony to provide religious freedom to all and soon became home to individuals of many religions. The Dutch founded what is now New York City, but this land was eventually absorbed into the British Empire. New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Delaware attracted many Irish, German and Scandinavian immigrants. By 1790 almost one half of the American population was not of British ancestry. Restrictions on immigration and importation of goods imposed by the British were a significant cause of the American Revolution. One of the grievances against the British monarch stated in the Declaration of Independence is that “<em>He has endeavored to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither</em>... “</p>
<div title="Page 2">
<p>After independence, the United States immigration laws were extremely permissive. The Naturalization Act of 1790, which was the first U. S. immigration law, placed no restrictions on immigration and allowed free whites to obtain citizenship after two years of residency in the United States. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, the United States had a free migration policy and had massive flows of immigrants from European nations, such as Ireland, and immigrants from Asia. This migration was its strongest around the time of the Irish Potato Famine. The inscription on the Statue of Liberty greeted the immigrants entering the country through Ellis Island with the following poem written by Emma Lazarus and titled The New Colossus. It summed up America's values toward immigrants,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame, With conquering limbs astride from land to land; Here at our sea­washed, sunset gates shall stand A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name Mother of Exiles. From her beacon­ hand Glows world­ wide welcome; her mild eyes command The air-­bridged harbor that twin cities frame. 'Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!' cries she With silent lips.

<p>America was open to immigrants throughout the world and was a nation of opportunities. It is clear that this history has made the United States a nation of diversity created by immigrants from all over the world. This American history of immigration is what makes being American not about what religious or ethnic group you are part of, but about the American values of liberty and equality that are so eloquently summed up by The New Colossus. American values have always been to create a nation where people from throughout the world could come to experience liberty and opportunity. What makes an American is therefore belief in these values, the values that have attracted and brought so many immigrants to the United States.</p>
<div title="Page 3">
<p>The core values of America that shape and created the nation are liberty and equality. These values have drawn immigrants to the nation since the Puritans, Pilgrims and Quakers first set foot in the New World looking for religious liberty. It is these values that define what being an American is and form the basis of the American community. America was founded to be a place where no king could arbitrarily interfere with basic liberties. Freedom and equality come hand in hand and cannot exist without each other.</p>
<div title="Page 3">
<p>Freedom in the American community means not being dominated over, and living in a community with other citizens that are equal in rights and opportunities. American poet and author Walt Whitman defined freedom as follows, “<em>Freedom --­ to walk free and own no superior.</em>“ and said this of being a citizen of America, “<em>Neither a servant nor a master am I</em>.” These values have motivated American activists throughout the nation's history to fight for what is right and to fight to bring liberty and equal opportunity to all.</p>
<div title="Page 3">
<p>The founders of the United States saw freedom and equality as inherently linked. Excessive inequality could result in aristocracy and would be corrosive to society and freedom. But freedom was inherently linked with accepting that all men are created equal. Alexis de Tocqueville, a famous French author who wrote about the early United States, said, “<em>Grant me thirty years of equal division of inheritances and a free press, and I will provide you with a republic.</em>” In the Federalist #10, James Madison stated that “<em>the most common and durable source of factions has been the various and unequal distribution of property. Those who hold and those who are without property have ever formed distinct interests in society.</em>”</p>
<div title="Page 4">
<p>The struggle for freedom and equality for all has defined the United States throughout its history and defines what it means to be an American. The biggest questions in American history have been “what is liberty?” and “what is the proper relation between liberty and order?” and the biggest struggles in American history have involved expanding freedom and equality. The greatest victories in these struggles have come in four waves. The first wave of this struggle came with the Revolutionary War and the formation of the new United States government. The second wave of the American struggle for freedom for all came with the U.S Civil War and its aftermath. The third wave of this struggle came with the Great Depression, the New Deal and the Second World War and its aftermath. The fourth wave was the Civil Rights Movement. The Declaration of Independence was the statement of the core values of America and its people. However, the realization that “<em>all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights</em>” came throughout the history of the United States and is still not entirely complete. The Declaration of Independence stated that the role of government ought to be to protect these rights and that a just government is based around the consent of the governed. After independence, American society became the closest in existence to a society without an aristocracy. A government was created that was the closest thing to a republic of laws, not men, that existed in the world. About a decade after the end of the revolution, a constitution was ratified that created a new national government for the United States. In its Preamble the Constitution stated its purpose as follows, “<em>to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity.</em>” Shortly thereafter, a second great American document was created, the Bill of Rights. This document protected many fundamental rights from government violation. Through many years of existence and legal interpretation, the Bill of Rights became a great American document that has played a large role in determining the nature of American freedom and liberty and has been at the heart of the shared American historical and cultural heritage. These documents are part of what makes America what it is and Americans who they are.</p>
<div title="Page 5">
<p>The history of the Civil War and reconstruction resulted in a great expansion of liberty, the end of slavery, and the expansion of the rights of citizenship to many Americans who did not receive those liberties before. The legal changes that happened during this period are most dramatically reflected in the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, which reads in part, “<em>No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.</em>” The 14th Amendment's declaration that all are equal before the law put the Declaration of Independence's most famous value into the constitution. It stated that all Americans have rights that must be protected by law. Furthermore, the Civil War and its aftermath helped define what it means to be American by creating an American national identity. Americans were Americans first and foremost instead of residents of their states first and foremost.</p>
<div title="Page 5">
<p>The New Deal era and the aftermath of World War II brought a new era in the expansion of rights in the United States. During the New Deal, it was realized that liberty included certain economic rights and that protecting the liberty of the population included giving everyone economic opportunities. In a tradition that went back to the nation's founding, it was realized that excessive concentrations of wealth were harmful and made it difficult to maintain the conditions needed for freedom to continue. The Second World War and its aftermath saw the exportation of the American values of freedom for all to the rest of the world. During the war, President Franklin D. Roosevelt made his Four Freedoms speech in which he stated that freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom from fear, and freedom from want were human rights that ought to be protected for all persons everywhere in the world. This speech served to be an inspiration for the development of the United Nations after the war, and the expansion of human rights to everyone throughout the world. The civil rights movement that started in the 1950s expanded the horizons of American liberty and freedom. The formal racial segregation and discrimination of the Jim Crow era was ended and economic discrimination was reduced. Courts made important civil rights and civil liberties decisions that expanded liberty and equality for all. Economic programs such Lyndon Johnson's Great Society expanded opportunity and alleviated poverty. During the 1970s and 80s women's rights were established and expanded., in a large part due to court victories won by activists.</p>
<div title="Page 6"><div title="Page 6">America is a nation of diversity created by a history of immigration, a nation not made of any one cultural or religious group. This nation has been a place where people of all kinds came for a better life throughout its entire history. This has been true since even before U.S independence. From Quaker and Puritan immigrants looking for religious freedom, to the immigrants of Ellis Island to modern immigrants, people have come to America looking for freedom. America has been a nation of ideals and laws, not of men or aristocracy, throughout its history. These values of freedom and equality have inspired struggle for all of America's history. While these struggles have never created a perfect union, America has become more perfect and a greater home to the blessings of liberty over its history. What makes a real American is not simply who you are, but it is our shared values and the belief that you have the freedom and opportunity to become all that you want to be, as long as you don't violate the freedoms and liberties of others. It is this belief in liberty and equality for all that makes America great and makes being an American great. The constitution gives Americans certain rights and our freedom and liberty are guaranteed. But what makes an American a real American is the respect for these values and the respect for the struggle that secured these freedoms, as well as a determination to continue to protect and fight for these values.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><p><a href="../../tag/civilwar.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#civilwar</a> <a href="../../tag/newdeal.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#newdeal</a> <a href="../../tag/newyorkcity.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#newyorkcity</a> <a href="../../tag/old.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#old</a> <a href="../../tag/old.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#old</a> <a href="../../tag/uncategorized.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#uncategorized</a> <a href="../../tag/unitedstates.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#unitedstates</a></p></div>                    </div>

<p>The history of United States immigration policy has been one of historical contradictions. The United States is in a way a nation of immigrants restricting immigration.Starting even before independence, America has been a melting pot of immigrants of different cultures and religions. British Puritans and Pilgrims migrated to the New World for religious liberty and settled in New England and founded the colonies of Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Connecticut. However, nativism has also been constant throughout U.S. history and is often tied to racism and nationalism--even in this nation of immigrants. This is despite the fact that immigration to the United States has brought great benefits to both the United States and other nations. Quaker immigrants settled Pennsylvania looking for religious freedom. Pennsylvania after Quaker settlement was the first colony to provide religious freedom to all and soon became home to individuals of many religions. The Dutch founded what is now New York City, but this land was eventually absorbed into the British Empire. New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Delaware attracted many Irish, German and Scandinavian immigrants. By 1790,almost-one half of the American population was not of British ancestry .[1. Szucs, Loretto Dennis, and Sandra Hargreaves Luebking. 2006. The source: a guidebook to American genealogy. Provo, UT: Ancestry.]<br /><!--more--><br />Restrictions on immigration by the British were a significant cause of the American Revolution. One of the grievances against the British monarch stated in the Declaration of Independence is that “He has endeavored to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither. . .“ After independence, the United States immigration laws were extremely permissive. The Naturalization Act of 1790, which was the first U. S. immigration law, placed no restrictions on immigration and allowed free whites to obtain citizenship after two years of residency in the United States.However, nationalistic fervor soon resulted in increased immigration restrictions. The more restrictive Naturalization Act of 1795 was passed as a result of fears that European immigrants could hold views that were counter to views of American liberty. In 1798 Congress passed the Alien and Sedition Acts, which extended the residency requirement to 14 years, along with enacting severe censorship of the press. This law was enacted because of a fear that French immigrants were fomenting rebellion and anarchy in the United States</p>

<p>In the mid to late 19th and early 20th centuries, the United States had an almost free migration policy and had massive flows of immigrants from European nations, such as Ireland, as well as immigrants from Asia. This migration was at its strongest around the time of the Irish Potato Famine and during this time period about 60 million immigrants migrated from Europe. In 1911, almost 15 percent of the United States population was foreign born. <a title="Immigration Helps the Economy" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140503011041/%3Ca%20href=" https:>https:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>theojones.name/<wbr></wbr>index.php/<wbr></wbr>2013/<wbr></wbr>09/<wbr></wbr>22/<wbr></wbr>immigration-helps-economy/<wbr></wbr></a>"&gt;This immigration had substantial benefits for both nations. It fueled much of United States industrial development in the period before World War I and immigration from 1840 to 1920 was a primary contributor to American urbanization. The migrants tended to be unskilled labor of the type best suited to employment in industry, compared to the highly skilled craftsmen who made up the bulk of native workers. This is because labor is a limiting factor to economic output in nations with high development of capital and technology. The result of migration, therefore, is an increase in industrial capacity triggered by the easing of that limiting factor. While the additional supply of labor may reduce wages to some degree, the increase in production enabled by immigration exceeded the change in wages, so overall economic output increased.[2. (Borjas, George J., and Valerie A. Ramey)].Additionally, the nations where the migrants emigrated from received great benefits from their migration flows. Nations with limited capital and technology development compared to the available labor are the most likely to produce emigrants. <a title="Immigration Helps the Economy" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140503011041/%3Ca%20href=" https:>https:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>theojones.name/<wbr></wbr>index.php/<wbr></wbr>2013/<wbr></wbr>09/<wbr></wbr>22/<wbr></wbr>immigration-helps-economy/<wbr></wbr></a>"&gt;This migration drives local wages up. . <br />However, despite the benefits of immigration to the United States, nationalism and racism prompted policy changes that greatly restricted this migration after World War I. All throughout the period of high immigration strong nativistic sentiment was always present. Irish Catholics were of particular concern. Often the Catholic Church and its Irish followers were viewed as a threat to freedom and promoters of tyrannical institutions. Ireland was the largest single source of immigrants, and in 1850, 47 percent of foreign-born Americans were Irish.</p>

<p>Showing a typical view of the anti-Irish sentiments of the time, inventor and artist Samuel Morse argued that while previous immigrants to the United States were “lovers of liberty,” the new immigrants were “selected for a service to their tyrants, and by their tyrants, not for their affinity for liberty, but for their mental servitude and their docility towards their priests ”. he opposition to immigration of Morse and others was despite the fact that the Irish immigrants showed no real opposition to core freedoms and Irish American Catholics were very strong defenders of religious freedom. In-fact, Irish-American Catholics were generally the most committed to separation of church and state of all Catholics during the mid to late 19th century and brought their liberal beliefs to the European church. In the late 1850s, the Know-Nothing party became the first anti-immigrant, xenophobic party to gain substantial electoral victories.</p>

<p>Mexico started to play an increasingly important role in United states immigration policy starting with World War I and continuing to current times. America's restrictions on immigration from Mexico have been influenced by the degree that we have needed Mexican workers. The labor shortages of World War I meant fewer restrictions on Mexican immigration. But as unemployment rose and many Americans began looking for jobs during the Great Depression, mass deportation of Mexican workers began. World War II again brought labor shortages and a guest-worker program was initiated, called the Bracero Program. By 1964, when the program ended, more than 4.5 million Mexicans had participated. In the era after Bracero, two issues came to dominate the American policy debate on immigration: protecting the United States borders from terrorists and illegal immigration, particularly from Mexico. The 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act was the first major immigration legislation after the repeal of the Bracero program and loosened many of the racily motivated immigration quotas. There was an increasing influx of illegal immigration into the United States at this point and this immigration was argued to be driving down the wages of American workers. The 1986 Immigration and Reform Act gave amnesty to 2.7 million immigrants who were in the United States without legal authorization.</p>

<p>The debate over U.S/Mexico immigration has been marred by nationalistic rhetoric, but there is strong evidence that this immigration flow is in general of benefit to both nations. <a href="http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2522570?uid=3739552&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21102668867717">A study authored by economist George Johnson did not find an any unemployment effect from Mexican immigration – including illegal immigration.</a> It also found that this immigration increases GDP. Some inequality effect, particularly in the long run, was seen. However, this inequality effect could be mitigated by government spending, services, and tax policy.</p>
