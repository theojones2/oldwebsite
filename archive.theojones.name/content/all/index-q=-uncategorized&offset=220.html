            </h2>
                    <p class="reading">
                <span class="vague">2 min read </span>
            </p>
            
<p>Steve Ballmer, the CEO of Microsoft for the past 13 years, <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/heres-microsoft-ceo-ballmers-goodbye-note-to-the-troops-7000019795/">has announced</a> that he will retire within the next 12 months.In<a href="http://www.zdnet.com/heres-microsoft-ceo-ballmers-goodbye-note-to-the-troops-7000019795/"> a letter</a> to Microsoft employees released this morning Ballmer stated that</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>My original thoughts on timing would have had my retirement happen in the middle of our transformation to a devices and services company focused on empowering customers in the activities they value most. We need a CEO who will be here longer term for this new direction. </em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Microsoft is certainly in need of a transition. According to Business Insider, Microsoft stock <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/ballmer-era-stock-price-2013-8">has fallen</a> over 40% during Ballmer's tenure.</p>

<p>Compare Ballmer's stock performance to that during Bill Gates' time as CEO (Ballmer started in 2000).</p>

<p>Microsoft's "transformation to a devices and services company" has consisted of a poorly executed imitation of Apple. This imitation is complete with <a href="http://www.tomsguide.com/us/xbox-one-microsoft-store-display,news-17421.html">Microsoft Stores</a> and a tablet/phone operating system <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-microsoft-ceo-steve-ballmers-failures-20130823,0,2666964.story">no one wants to use</a>.During Ballmer's term Microsoft lost the server market to GNU/Linux based operating systems and failed to put forth a marketable alternative to Android and Apple smartphones and tablets.<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/12/13/windows_market_share_just_20percent/">According to a report released by Goldman Sachs,</a> Microsoft has fallen from almost total dominance of the computer market to just over 20% market share. As the following graph from report makes clear, this change took place almost entirely during Ballmer's tenure.</p>

<p>What about product quality? Well the same tribute comedian David Letterman aired after Bill Gates' retirement could very well be used to describe Microsoft under Ballmer.</p>

            </h2>
                    <p class="reading">
                <span class="vague">3 min read </span>

<p><a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121986172394776997.html?mod=hps_us_pageone&amp;cb=logged0.4228730972390622">After a 1989 merger the Roanoke, Va hospital market became concentrated in the hands of one company</a>, Carilion Health Systems. By the most recent accounts profits of the company reached 107 million dollars and the pay of its CEO reached $2.07 million. However, things are not going as well for Carilion's patients. Carilion's colonoscopy fees are 4 to 10 times those of nearby health-care providers and their CT scan fees are almost three times those of other providers.  After the formation of the monopoly, insurance premiums soared in Roanoke. This change was largely driven by Carilion's high fees. Before the merger premiums were 20% lower than those of nearby Richmond. Now premiums in Roanoke are the highest in Virginia.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, such monopolies are all too common in the American health care system. Hospital owners and management get rich while patients get shafted with high fees. Or in many cases bodies that control the care provided at many hospitals pull their weight to ensure that needed care is not provided at all.</p>

<p><a href="http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/suppl/2003/12/12/hlthaff.w3.472v1.DC1">A study published in the journal <em>Health Affairs </em>f</a>ound substantial market concentration in the health care market that is sufficient to allow hospitals to charge public insurance providers (such as Medicare and Medicaid) different prices than those demanded of private insurance providers and individuals. In particular, hospitals can shift costs onto private insurance providers. The evidence suggests that for-profit providers are more likely to abuse their market power then non-profit providers. This differential pricing would be unlikely to occur in a competitive market because competition, and the risk of being undercut by other hospitals, would tend to push the maximum price down to a level near the cost of production.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/08/hospital-prices-cost-differences_n_3232678.html?1367985666">A review of prices charged by hospitals in the greater New York City metropolitan area</a> found vast differences in prices charged for equivalent COPD treatments. The most expensive hospital charged $99,690. The cheapest hospital charged $7,044.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21756018">A 2011 study concluded that</a> "Hospital markets in the United States now mostly fall within the definitions adopted by the DOJ [Department of Justice] and FTC [Federal Trade Commission] as moderately to highly concentrated" and that "Hospitals in concentrated markets charge significantly higher prices and earn significantly higher margins from private insurers than do hospitals in competitive markets."</p>

<p><a href="http://ncronline.org/news/catholic-hospitals-serve-one-six-patients-united-states">One in every 6</a> hospital patients in America is served at a Catholic hospital. <a href="http://rhrealitycheck.org/article/2013/03/25/dont-take-her-to-catholic-hospital/">Almost 10%</a> of the religious hospitals in the United States are the sole provider of hospital care in their area. However, this vast patient body gives the Church substantial power to set the range of health care provided in the United States.  Many more are in highly concentrated markets and face only limited competition.  The Catholic Church requires the hospitals under its control to follow “<a title="(Open in new tab) " href="http://www.usccb.org/about/doctrine/ethical-and-religious-directives/" rel="external">Ethical and Religious Directives</a>” which often<a href="http://rhrealitycheck.org/article/2013/06/06/do-religious-restrictions-force-doctors-to-commit-malpractice/"> contradict generally accepted medical practices</a>.</p>

<p>What should be done to increase competition in the health care market? First of all increased anti-trust enforcement should be applied to the health care market and hospital chains in concentrated markets should be broken up. In areas where there is not sufficient demand for hospital services to support a competitive market a publicly owned hospital monopoly is preferable to a private one.</p>

            </h2>
                    <p class="reading">
                <span class="vague">2 min read </span>
            </p>
            <p>Japan's prime minister Shinzo Abe <a href="http://japandailypress.com/pm-abe-says-its-his-historic-mission-to-change-japans-constitution-1333768/">has stated that he</a> "will strive toward constitutional revisions for the future” and that changing Japan's constitution, which has remained unattended since its ratification in 1947, is part of his “historic mission”. These changes have become possible as Abe's party won a sizable majority in the Diet -- the country's legislative body -- <a href="http://japandailypress.com/voter-turnout-for-japans-upper-house-elections-low-even-with-internet-campaigning-2232679/">despite low voter turnout</a>. <a href="http://japandailypress.com/pm-abe-says-he-intends-to-revise-constitution-in-bid-to-get-more-votes-for-ldp-1732466/">To obtain the needed 2/3rds of both houses of the Diet,</a> Abe will still need substantial cooperation from outside his own party. <br />
However, it appears that many of the suggested changes are very troubling. Article 9 of Japan's constitution prohibits the use of military force to solve political disputes and declares that "land, sea, and air forces, as well as other war potential, will never be maintained". While the exact wording of the proposed amendments have not yet been released it is likely that these restrictions on the military will likely be reduced. Likely changes include permitting preemptive military offensives and an expansion of Japan's Self Defense Forces. <a href="http://www.chinapost.com.tw/editorial/world-issues/2013/08/05/385502/p2/Japan's-pacifist.htm">A draft declares that</a> Japanese citizens have an obligation to “guard the sovereignty of the land, sea, and air territories of the nation” and creates a formal Japanese military force. <br />
Even more troubling are the proposed reductions to protections of civil liberties.According to a NPR report a proposed amendment <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=213578220">will place the goal protecting public order</a> at a priority superior to protecting individual rights. <a href="http://www.chinapost.com.tw/editorial/world-issues/2013/08/05/385502/Japans-pacifist.htm">The proposed amendment</a> declares that while the government should “respect the rights of the individual to the greatest extent”, but only when “maintaining public order” is not threatened. The amendment then states that "[the citizenry] must have self-consciousness regarding the responsibilities and duties that come with freedom." <br />
Another amendment, which Abe proposes to put to a vote before his other proposals, will reduce the barrier to passing constitutional amendments.  </p><p><a href="../../tag/npr.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#npr</a> <a href="../../tag/old.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#old</a> <a href="../../tag/old.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#old</a> <a href="../../tag/shinzoabe.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#shinzoabe</a> <a href="../../tag/uncategorized.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#uncategorized</a></p></div>                    </div>

<p>Ever feel like the Republicans are just the party of no, just trying to block all productive work until they get back into the White House? Turns out you are not alone. Conservative talk show host Laura Ingraham told Republicans on her show yesterday that “Your job as an opposition party is to stand against what</p>

            </p>
            
<p>While there are many things we should be concerned about with the NSA's vast data collection programs, in my opinion the worst is the fact that politicians are making many critical decisions about our privacy rights in secret without public debate. This secrecy is an assault on the basic principles of the rule of law and democracy.</p>

<p>As the<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/07/us/in-secret-court-vastly-broadens-powers-of-nsa.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp;"> New York Times reports t</a>he court has "created a secret body of law" and has assumed a role that is greatly beyond its initial purpose of "approving case-by-case wiretapping orders". In secret, and without making public any justifications for its decisions, the court has approved vast data collection programs. <a href="http://wonkette.com/521997/fisa-court-busy-making-awesome-secret-law-awesomely-in-secret">Additionally</a> the court , has reinterpreted the definition of “foreign intelligence” to include not just communications involving a foreign national, but also many communications between Americans. The FISA court <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/08/new-leak-nsa-can-search-us-e-mail-data-but-theoretically-isnt-allowed-to/">has declared</a> that the NSA can collect all American email data and create a system that allows this data to be searched -- even when the emails are between Americans using an American service provider. It is likely that the NSA has used this power to search American emails.Why won't the FISA court release summaries of its rulings? As the top judge on the court explains, the public <a href="http://www.fas.org/irp/agency/doj/fisa/fisc-032713.pdf">cannot be trusted to "understand"</a> the decisions -- especially after important details are edited out of released opinions. Furthermore, actually giving the public even a summary of what the government is doing on its behalf would overwork the judges so much that the expanded workload  "would have a detrimental impact on the FISC's ability to address matters currently before the court" because "small number of judges, attorneys, and staff that comprise the FISC are fully occupied by its current caseload".</p>

<p>Why do I call this great secrecy the worst element of the NSA program? In a free society it is necessary that policy makers are held to governing in the public's interest, not their own. The only way to make sure that the government is held accountable is to create a political and legal system where voters and the public have the ability to effectively contest government policy. The public must know what the government is doing on its behalf in-order to evaluate the actions of the state. A secret court is unable to fully hear and take into account opposing arguments. Furthermore, even if the NSA program turns out to be legal, secret decisions cannot be contested on election day and the politicians who allowed the spying program will not face any consequences if they have made a bad call. It is ultimately the task of voters' to decide if the NSA programs have employed the proper level of protections for privacy but if the executive branch orders and court decisions allowing these programs are not known to the public, voters will not be able to make this evaluation.</p>

<p>[caption id="attachment_317" align="alignright" width="203"] Unveiling of the Statue of Liberty Enlightening the World (1886) by Edward Moran[/caption]</p>

<p>What are the values that have made America and Americans different? An American can be of any race, creed, religion, philosophy, or ethnicity. The United States has never been a country of one religious or ethnic group, and Americans have many diverse political philosophies. The ideal of America has been that of a country where immigrants from throughout the world could come and make a good life and where Americans from all socioeconomic backgrounds could move up the economic ladder, or at the least attain a good education and provide for themselves and their families if they work hard. America has always been a melting pot and a nation of diversity. America is a home for persons of all types­­ there is no one stereotypical real American.</p>

<p>Americans enjoy freedom of speech and religion and live under a legal system that protects these basic individual rights. What makes a real American is the strong belief in these values and the freedoms that come with being a citizen of the United States, as well as respect for those values and freedoms. The United States was founded to be a country where the most famous lines of the Declaration of Independence -- a document ratified 237 years ago today -- ring true, where “<em>We hold these truths to be self­ evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.</em>”</p>
<div title="Page 1">
<p>America was founded to be a nation of laws, not men, where there would never be a European­style aristocracy and where all were equal in rights and opportunity. These values are inherently both communal and individual as both liberty and equality involve the relations between individuals to other individuals in society. Because of this, the power of community has been at the heart of what makes America great. While these values and hopes have never been fully implemented, and there are still great inequities in American society, these values form the heart and soul of America and its people.</p>
<div title="Page 1">
<p>The fact that America is a nation of diversity can be seen in where Americans have come from. There have been Americans that have come from almost all cultural groups in the world.</p>
<div title="Page 2">
<p>Starting even before independence, America has been a melting pot of immigrants of different cultures and religions. British Puritans and Pilgrims migrated to the New World for religious liberty and settled in New England and founded the colonies of Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Connecticut. Quaker immigrants settled Pennsylvania looking for religious freedom. Pennsylvania after Quaker settlement was the first colony to provide religious freedom to all and soon became home to individuals of many religions. The Dutch founded what is now New York City, but this land was eventually absorbed into the British Empire. New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Delaware attracted many Irish, German and Scandinavian immigrants. By 1790 almost one half of the American population was not of British ancestry. Restrictions on immigration and importation of goods imposed by the British were a significant cause of the American Revolution. One of the grievances against the British monarch stated in the Declaration of Independence is that “<em>He has endeavored to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither</em>... “</p>
<div title="Page 2">
<p>After independence, the United States immigration laws were extremely permissive. The Naturalization Act of 1790, which was the first U. S. immigration law, placed no restrictions on immigration and allowed free whites to obtain citizenship after two years of residency in the United States. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, the United States had a free migration policy and had massive flows of immigrants from European nations, such as Ireland, and immigrants from Asia. This migration was its strongest around the time of the Irish Potato Famine. The inscription on the Statue of Liberty greeted the immigrants entering the country through Ellis Island with the following poem written by Emma Lazarus and titled The New Colossus. It summed up America's values toward immigrants,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame, With conquering limbs astride from land to land; Here at our sea­washed, sunset gates shall stand A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name Mother of Exiles. From her beacon­ hand Glows world­ wide welcome; her mild eyes command The air-­bridged harbor that twin cities frame. 'Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!' cries she With silent lips. 'Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest ­tossed to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!'”</p>
</blockquote><div title="Page 3">
<p>America was open to immigrants throughout the world and was a nation of opportunities. It is clear that this history has made the United States a nation of diversity created by immigrants from all over the world. This American history of immigration is what makes being American not about what religious or ethnic group you are part of, but about the American values of liberty and equality that are so eloquently summed up by The New Colossus. American values have always been to create a nation where people from throughout the world could come to experience liberty and opportunity. What makes an American is therefore belief in these values, the values that have attracted and brought so many immigrants to the United States.</p>
<div title="Page 3">
<p>The core values of America that shape and created the nation are liberty and equality. These values have drawn immigrants to the nation since the Puritans, Pilgrims and Quakers first set foot in the New World looking for religious liberty. It is these values that define what being an American is and form the basis of the American community. America was founded to be a place where no king could arbitrarily interfere with basic liberties. Freedom and equality come hand in hand and cannot exist without each other.</p>
<div title="Page 3">
<p>Freedom in the American community means not being dominated over, and living in a community with other citizens that are equal in rights and opportunities. American poet and author Walt Whitman defined freedom as follows, “<em>Freedom --­ to walk free and own no superior.</em>“ and said this of being a citizen of America, “<em>Neither a servant nor a master am I</em>.” These values have motivated American activists throughout the nation's history to fight for what is right and to fight to bring liberty and equal opportunity to all.</p>
<div title="Page 3">
<p>The founders of the United States saw freedom and equality as inherently linked. Excessive inequality could result in aristocracy and would be corrosive to society and freedom. But freedom was inherently linked with accepting that all men are created equal. Alexis de Tocqueville, a famous French author who wrote about the early United States, said, “<em>Grant me thirty years of equal division of inheritances and a free press, and I will provide you with a republic.</em>” In the Federalist #10, James Madison stated that “<em>the most common and durable source of factions has been the various and unequal distribution of property. Those who hold and those who are without property have ever formed distinct interests in society.</em>”</p>

<p>The struggle for freedom and equality for all has defined the United States throughout its history and defines what it means to be an American. The biggest questions in American history have been “what is liberty?” and “what is the proper relation between liberty and order?” and the biggest struggles in American history have involved expanding freedom and equality. The greatest victories in these struggles have come in four waves. The first wave of this struggle came with the Revolutionary War and the formation of the new United States government. The second wave of the American struggle for freedom for all came with the U.S Civil War and its aftermath. The third wave of this struggle came with the Great Depression, the New Deal and the Second World War and its aftermath. The fourth wave was the Civil Rights Movement. The Declaration of Independence was the statement of the core values of America and its people. However, the realization that “<em>all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights</em>” came throughout the history of the United States and is still not entirely complete. The Declaration of Independence stated that the role of government ought to be to protect these rights and that a just government is based around the consent of the governed. After independence, American society became the closest in existence to a society without an aristocracy. A government was created that was the closest thing to a republic of laws, not men, that existed in the world. About a decade after the end of the revolution, a constitution was ratified that created a new national government for the United States. In its Preamble the Constitution stated its purpose as follows, “<em>to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity.</em>” Shortly thereafter, a second great American document was created, the Bill of Rights. This document protected many fundamental rights from government violation. Through many years of existence and legal interpretation, the Bill of Rights became a great American document that has played a large role in determining the nature of American freedom and liberty and has been at the heart of the shared American historical and cultural heritage. These documents are part of what makes America what it is and Americans who they are.</p>
<div title="Page 5">
<p>The history of the Civil War and reconstruction resulted in a great expansion of liberty, the end of slavery, and the expansion of the rights of citizenship to many Americans who did not receive those liberties before. The legal changes that happened during this period are most dramatically reflected in the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, which reads in part, “<em>No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.</em>” The 14th Amendment's declaration that all are equal before the law put the Declaration of Independence's most famous value into the constitution. It stated that all Americans have rights that must be protected by law. Furthermore, the Civil War and its aftermath helped define what it means to be American by creating an American national identity. Americans were Americans first and foremost instead of residents of their states first and foremost.</p>
<div title="Page 5">
<p>The New Deal era and the aftermath of World War II brought a new era in the expansion of rights in the United States. During the New Deal, it was realized that liberty included certain economic rights and that protecting the liberty of the population included giving everyone economic opportunities. In a tradition that went back to the nation's founding, it was realized that excessive concentrations of wealth were harmful and made it difficult to maintain the conditions needed for freedom to continue. The Second World War and its aftermath saw the exportation of the American values of freedom for all to the rest of the world. During the war, President Franklin D. Roosevelt made his Four Freedoms speech in which he stated that freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom from fear, and freedom from want were human rights that ought to be protected for all persons everywhere in the world. This speech served to be an inspiration for the development of the United Nations after the war, and the expansion of human rights to everyone throughout the world. The civil rights movement that started in the 1950s expanded the horizons of American liberty and freedom. The formal racial segregation and discrimination of the Jim Crow era was ended and economic discrimination was reduced. Courts made important civil rights and civil liberties decisions that expanded liberty and equality for all. Economic programs such Lyndon Johnson's Great Society expanded opportunity and alleviated poverty. During the 1970s and 80s women's rights were established and expanded., in a large part due to court victories won by activists.</p>
<div title="Page 6"><div title="Page 6">America is a nation of diversity created by a history of immigration, a nation not made of any one cultural or religious group. This nation has been a place where people of all kinds came for a better life throughout its entire history. This has been true since even before U.S independence. From Quaker and Puritan immigrants looking for religious freedom, to the immigrants of Ellis Island to modern immigrants, people have come to America looking for freedom. America has been a nation of ideals and laws, not of men or aristocracy, throughout its history. These values of freedom and equality have inspired struggle for all of America's history. While these struggles have never created a perfect union, America has become more perfect and a greater home to the blessings of liberty over its history. What makes a real American is not simply who you are, but it is our shared values and the belief that you have the freedom and opportunity to become all that you want to be, as long as you don't violate the freedoms and liberties of others. It is this belief in liberty and equality for all that makes America great and makes being an American great. The constitution gives Americans certain rights and our freedom and liberty are guaranteed. But what makes an American a real American is the respect for these values and the respect for the struggle that secured these freedoms, as well as a determination to continue to protect and fight for these values.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><p><a href="../../tag/ellisisland.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#ellisisland</a> <a href="../../tag/newdeal.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#newdeal</a> <a href="../../tag/newworld.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#newworld</a> <a href="../../tag/old.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#old</a> <a href="../../tag/old.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#old</a> <a href="../../tag/uncategorized.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#uncategorized</a> <a href="../../tag/unitedstates.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#unitedstates</a></p></div>                    </div>

            </h2>
                    <p class="reading">
                <span class="vague">4 min read </span>
            </p>
            
<p>How about 117 degrees Fahrenheit for hot weather? <a href="http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/heat-wave-unabated-rajasthan-s-sriganganagar-sizzles-at-48-2-degrees-370148">This was the high temperature during last month's heat wave in Sriganganagar, India</a>. While single events, including this heat wave, cannot be attributed individually to climate change, global warming will make such events much more likely. The planet is undergoing one of the most rapid periods of temperature change in the history of the Earth. This level of change is only exceeded by what occurred during the five mass extinctions, the most recent of these being the Cretaceous-Tertiary event which caused the extinction of the dinosaurs. The rate of biodiversity loss due to current human caused climate change may be <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/Default.aspx?id=3897120&amp;p1=0#.UZ2bu3wy0b0">sufficient to qualify as a mass extinction fully on par</a> with these events by mid-century.</p>

<p>In this article, I will show the evidence that there is an increase in global temperature of about 0.16 degrees Celsius per decade. The following chart from NASA shows the rise of global average temperature to a level that is 1.5C above pre-industrial levels and 0.6C above mid-20th century levels.</p>

<p>[caption id="attachment_159" align="aligncenter" width="300"] Click to enlarge image. <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/news/topstory/2008/earth_temp.html">Image description from NASA</a>: "Graph of global annual surface temperatures relative to 1951-1980 mean temperature. Air and ocean data from weather stations, ships and satellites. The 2007 point is the 11-month anomaly."[/caption]</p>

<p>This graph clearly shows a dramatic and exponential rise in global surface temperatures. While often criticized, researchers have confirmed this general temperature trend many times. A <a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/2012/07/berkeley-earth-project-is-back-to-re-re-confirm-earth-is-warming/">recent confirmation of this data was done by former climate change skeptic Richard Muller</a> in his <a href="http://berkeleyearth.org">Berkeley Earth</a> project. Muller was funded by many conservative groups which believed that his work offered one of the best opportunities for a scientific falsification of global warming theory.As the following chart shows, the Berkeley Earth results are effectively the same as previous attempts to measure global temperature.</p>

<p>[caption id="attachment_163" align="aligncenter" width="300"] Click to enlarge image. "Land temperature with 1- and 10-year running averages. The shaded regions are the one- and two-standard deviation uncertainties calculated including both statistical and spatial sampling errors. Prior land results from the other groups are also plotted. The NASA GISS record had a land mask applied; the HadCRU curve is the simple land average, not the hemispheric-weighted one." Image and caption from Berkeley Earth <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130723044740/%3Ca%20href=" http:>http:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>berkeleyearth.org:80/<wbr></wbr>results-summary/<wbr></wbr></a>"&gt;<a href="http://berkeleyearth.org/results-summary/%5B/caption">http:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>berkeleyearth.org/<wbr></wbr>results-summary/<wbr></wbr>[/<wbr></wbr>caption</a>]The above chart compares the temperature reconstructions made by Berkeley Earth with other temperature measurements, including the NASA results used in the first graph. All of the major data sets come to effectively the same result for recent temperatures. Despite claims from climate change skeptics that "urban heating, data selection, poor station quality, and data adjustment" has biased past attempts to measure global temperatures, Berkeley Earth has found that "these [factors] do not unduly bias the results".</p>

<p>There are many short-term effects such as the El Nino, La Nina cycle that can cause temporary reductions in global temperatures. But as the following animation shows these effects do not nullify the greater global temperature trends.</p>

<p>[/caption]</p>

<p>The current rapid increases in global temperature can be confirmed in other ways. As this image produced by the Environmental Protection Agency shows, Arctic ice is melting at a rapid rate.</p>

<p>[caption id="attachment_172" align="aligncenter" width="300"] Click to enlarge.[/caption]</p>

<p>In a period of just 28 years, climate change reduced Arctic ice by over a third. Ice melts when heated. This reduction in ice coverage reflects and supports the conclusion that temperatures are soaring.Temperatures in the Arctic have increased at a rate four times the world average.</p>

<p>The case that the world is warming is very strong. As I will show in my next post, we are causing this increase. If this increase in global temperature continues, the results will be catastrophic.</p>

            </h2>
                    <p class="reading">
                <span class="vague">4 min read </span>
            </p>
            
<p>The Interstate 5 bridge over the Skagit River in Washington state <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/05/23/1211354/-I-5-bridge-over-Skagit-River-collapses-cars-with-people-in-water">collapsed last week</a> causing no deaths, but the collapse injured <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/24/washington-bridge-collapse_n_3331536.html">at least three people</a>. It is clear that the officials responsible for maintaining the bridge did not have the funding needed to keep the bridge system in good repair. This incident showcases the need for a massive, Works Progress Administration style push to repair our infrastructure.</p>

<p>Before I go into what needs to be done with our infrastructure, let's first review what happened in Washington .As reported by KOMO.News, a local television station, a Washington Department of Transportation spokesperson <a href="http://www.komonews.com/news/local/Cars-bodies-in-Skagit-River-after-I-5-Bridge-collapse--208760201.html">was not aware when the bridge was last inspected</a>. Furthermore, the Federal Highway Administration classified the bridge as "functionally obsolete" because it had an outdated design that does not meet current standards for new bridge construction. From KOMO,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bart Treece with WDOT was unsure when the bridge was last inspected.  <br />"All of our bridges in the area are pretty old," he said.  <br />The bridge is not considered structurally deficient but is listed as being "functionally obsolete" - a category meaning that their design is outdated, such as having narrow shoulders are low clearance underneath, according to a database compiled by the Federal Highway Administration.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There were other issues with the bridge and many others in the state.A 1992 federal report <a href="http://uglybridges.com/1589303">recommended that the I-5 bridge be replaced</a> at a cost of 8.3 million dollars. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20131029033245/%3Ca%20href=" http:>http:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>blogs.asce.org/<wbr></wbr>govrel/<wbr></wbr>2013/<wbr></wbr>05/<wbr></wbr>21/<wbr></wbr>washington-state-report-card-released-today/<wbr></wbr></a>"&gt;37 percent of the state's bridges have been in use for a time frame exceeding their designed lifespan. According to the Seattle Times,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The bridge, built in 1955, has a sufficiency rating of 57.4 out of 100, according to federal records. That is well below the statewide average rating of 80, according to an Associated Press analysis of federal data, but 759 bridges in the state have a lower sufficiency score.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The fact that the I-5 Bridge and many like it have not received needed maintenance shows the need for new investment in infrastructure. The government needs to commit o<a href="http://www.infrastructurereportcard.org/a/#p/bridges/investment-and-funding">ver 120 billion dollars</a> to fix our bridges. <a href="http://www.infrastructurereportcard.org/a/#p/bridges/overview">Budgets for future road repairs need</a> to be increased by 8 billion dollars per year. Despite the clear facts, politicians have done just the opposite.  As the graph I open my blog post with shows, spending on infrastructure has actually decreased during the ongoing recession.</p>

<p>To supplement and complete infrastructure investment the federal government should enact a Works Progress Administration style jobs push. The government should pledge to hire anyone willing and able to work at minimum wage and put those hired to work on public projects, including infrastructure improvements.This program should continue even after unemployment is lowered to regular levels. A major push on infrastructure will create many jobs and many workers will be hired to complete the construction work. The current high level of unemployment shows that there is much surplus economic  capacity able to be put to work.</p>

<p>In a depressed economy the United States government can increase spending without the need for increased taxation or other ill effects. The deficit is not a limiting factor for government investment. A country with its own, floating, non-convertable (a currency where the issuer does not pledge to convert currency for a commodity on demand) currency is not constrained in its government spending by absolute debt or deficit levels. The<a href="http://neweconomicperspectives.org/2012/01/mmp-blog-31-functional-finance-monetary.html"> only constraints on spending are the effects that the spending has on inflation, unemployment, demand</a> and other economic outcomes.</p>

<p>Any complaints that the debt would be increased by infrastructure improvements are not grounds to let our roads and bridges rot. There are many needed infrastructure improvements. The government should start on them as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Is the idea of global warming a new concept--just a fad-- something dreamed up by tree huggers and Al Gore with scientists jumping on the propaganda bandwagon? Climate change denialists, like <a href="http://wattsupwiththat.com/">Anthony Watts</a> [1. See for instance this article <a href="http://wattsupwiththat.com/2011/06/25/the-end-is-near-for-faith-in-agw/"></a><a href="http://wattsupwiththat.com/2011/06/25/the-end-is-near-for-faith-in-agw/">http:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>wattsupwiththat.com/<wbr></wbr>2011/<wbr></wbr>06/<wbr></wbr>25/<wbr></wbr>the-end-is-near-for-faith-in-agw/<wbr></wbr></a>], would have you believe that. But the truth is scientists have been studying it for more than 100 years.</p>

<p>The first scientist that theorized the possibility that the combustion of coal fuels could result in a global increase in temperature was chemist Svante Arrhenius,</p>

<p>[caption id="attachment_105" align="alignright" width="239"] Svante Arrhenius (<a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Arrhenius2.jpg">Image from Wikimedia Commons</a>)[/caption]</p>

<p><a href="http://www.aip.org/history/climate/co2.htm">who in 1896 theorized that coal burning could warm the climate at a scale similar to the effect caused by geologic sources</a>, such as volcanoes. He first estimated that a carbon dioxide increase sufficient to double CO2, and thereby increase global temperatures by 5 degrees Celsius, would take a few thousand years. By 1908, he had reduced this estimate to a few hundred years. However, Arrhenius' model of the climate was simplistic and the possibility that human activity and changes in CO2 level could increase global temperature was disregarded until the 1950s.</p>

<p>During that decade, new models were created that added support to this theory, but the evidence was still not conclusive. In the late 1970s, this began to change. Computers allowed the creation of accurate and detailed estimates of the possibility of human-caused climate change, and these estimates were calculated and widely accepted. In 1979, the United States National Academy of Sciences released a report warning of human-caused climate change [2. Archer, David, and Stefan Rahmstorf. The climate crisis: an introductory guide to climate change. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2010. Page x.], marking the first general acceptance of this theory.</p>

<p>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was created in 1988 to study the possibility of climate change and its impacts. The first IPCC report, published in 1990, found that a human-caused increase in global temperatures was likely, but not conclusive. The IPCC also found that the evidence should be conclusive within a decade. In their 2007 assessment on the physical science basis of climate change, the fourth and most recent assessment available at this time, the IPCC found that levels of three greenhouse gasses, carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, in the atmosphere had increased dramatically since the Industrial Revolution. According to the IPCC, these increases in greenhouse gasses have warmed and changed the climate and are human caused with a very high probability. Out of the three, the effect of carbon dioxide is the most significant.</p>

<p>Over 97 percent of climate scientists agree that human-caused climate change is happening and has the potential to cause severe harm. Some might say that this means nothing. But I believe that when 97 percent of scientists believe something, we should listen, especially when there is a whole century of evidence to back them up.</p>
