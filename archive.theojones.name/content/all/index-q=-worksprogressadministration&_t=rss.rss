      <description><![CDATA[<div>
        
<p>50 years ago this month Lyndon Johnson gave his War on Poverty speech, which was the beginning of most of the U.S government's anti-poverty programs. While these programs have made a clear dent in poverty, they have not come close to eliminating poverty. We need to do more. In this post I will detail how America can solve the poverty issue.</p>
<ol><li>The U.S government should commit to alleviating unemployment and maintaining full employment. This should include
<ol><li>The creation of a Works Progress Administration style jobs program that would be able to offer every unemployed person who is willing and able to work a job at a living wage. This program would employ the workers on infrastructure programs, providing public services, and projects done in collaboration with private non-profit groups. This program should continue even after the effects of the recession are over.</li>
    <li>The government should provide grants to unemployed workers and low income individuals who intend to start a business. This program would evaluate proposals based on their cost, the number of people employed by the businesses, and the benefit to the public that would be created by the proposals.</li>
    <li>The U.S government should aggressively use monetary policy to encourage private investment. This should include a continuation of the zero interest rate policy -- possibly indefinitely.</li>
    <li>The government should aggressively use fiscal policy to keep the economy at full employment. This should include increased deficits when the economy is sluggish and reduced deficits/ surpluses when there is a high risk of inflation.</li>
</ol></li> <br /><li>The current set of anti-poverty programs<a title="The Best Way to Eliminate Poverty in the United States" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140326141202/&lt;a%20href=" https:>https:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>theojones.name/<wbr></wbr>index.php/<wbr></wbr>2013/<wbr></wbr>09/<wbr></wbr>17/<wbr></wbr>best-way-eliminate-poverty-united-states/<wbr></wbr></a>"&gt; should be replaced with a basic income program that would provide a universal cash grant to all U.S adult citizens that is delivered unconditionally and without means testing  .</li>
    <li><a title="What should be done with the U.S health care system?" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140326141811/&lt;a%20href=" https:>https:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>theojones.name/<wbr></wbr>index.php/<wbr></wbr>2014/<wbr></wbr>01/<wbr></wbr>05/<wbr></wbr>done-u-s-health-care-system/<wbr></wbr></a>"&gt;A universal health care system should be adopted. </li>

<p><a href="https://theojones.name/index.php/poverty-a-economic-and-moral-crisis-in-america/" title="Poverty: A Economic and Moral Crisis in America">As I have previously discussed</a>, poverty is a great problem in America.</p>
<p dir="ltr">To replace many of the current welfare programs that we have in the United States, I would recommend a basic income program along the lines of the negative income tax proposal created by the Nobel Prize winning economist Milton Friedman.</p><p dir="ltr">Every family would receive a sum of money from the federal government to make their income above the poverty line level. All income earned separately, apart from the federal government grant would be taxed at a flat rate to help pay for the program. This proposal would simplify the current welfare programs by replacing many of them with a single program. Because everyone would get to keep the income they earned by working, without effecting the lump sum paid to them, someone is always better off working. Also an income level just barely above the poverty line isn't enough to take away someone's motivation to work, since isn't very much money and wouldn't provide for many or any extras or luxuries.</p><p dir="ltr">This sum of money would be distributed through the federal income tax system as a refundable tax credit.  If you owed no taxes, instead of a tax credit, you would receive a grant check from the federal government.</p><!--more--><p dir="ltr">A negative income tax isn't just some idea that some economist came up with, during the 1960s and 70s this idea was seriously considered by the federal government. In 1969 Richard Nixon proposed a bill that would have created a basic income through a negative income tax system. The bill failed in the Senate.  The Johnson administration studied the possibility of a negative income tax and George McGovern proposed it during his failed 1972 presidential campaign.</p>
<p>This system would give the working poor a living wage that would not take away their motivation to work. To help the unemployed, I would recommend that we create a jobs program to help them. This could provide work and help the United States by improving its infrastructure and creating alternative energy projects. This would work like the Works Progress Administration, which was created during the Great Depression to reduce unemployment.  It constructed roads streets, parks and other public buildings.</p>

      <title>Collapse of I-5 Bridge in Washington Shows the Need to Improve Infrastructure</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div>
        
<p>The Interstate 5 bridge over the Skagit River in Washington state <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/05/23/1211354/-I-5-bridge-over-Skagit-River-collapses-cars-with-people-in-water">collapsed last week</a> causing no deaths, but the collapse injured <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/24/washington-bridge-collapse_n_3331536.html">at least three people</a>. It is clear that the officials responsible for maintaining the bridge did not have the funding needed to keep the bridge system in good repair. This incident showcases the need for a massive, Works Progress Administration style push to repair our infrastructure.</p>

<p>Before I go into what needs to be done with our infrastructure, let's first review what happened in Washington .As reported by KOMO.News, a local television station, a Washington Department of Transportation spokesperson <a href="http://www.komonews.com/news/local/Cars-bodies-in-Skagit-River-after-I-5-Bridge-collapse--208760201.html">was not aware when the bridge was last inspected</a>. Furthermore, the Federal Highway Administration classified the bridge as "functionally obsolete" because it had an outdated design that does not meet current standards for new bridge construction. From KOMO,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bart Treece with WDOT was unsure when the bridge was last inspected.  <br />"All of our bridges in the area are pretty old," he said.  <br />The bridge is not considered structurally deficient but is listed as being "functionally obsolete" - a category meaning that their design is outdated, such as having narrow shoulders are low clearance underneath, according to a database compiled by the Federal Highway Administration.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There were other issues with the bridge and many others in the state.A 1992 federal report <a href="http://uglybridges.com/1589303">recommended that the I-5 bridge be replaced</a> at a cost of 8.3 million dollars. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20131029033245/&lt;a%20href=" http:>http:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>blogs.asce.org/<wbr></wbr>govrel/<wbr></wbr>2013/<wbr></wbr>05/<wbr></wbr>21/<wbr></wbr>washington-state-report-card-released-today/<wbr></wbr></a>"&gt;37 percent of the state's bridges have been in use for a time frame exceeding their designed lifespan. According to the Seattle Times,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The bridge, built in 1955, has a sufficiency rating of 57.4 out of 100, according to federal records. That is well below the statewide average rating of 80, according to an Associated Press analysis of federal data, but 759 bridges in the state have a lower sufficiency score.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The fact that the I-5 Bridge and many like it have not received needed maintenance shows the need for new investment in infrastructure. The government needs to commit o<a href="http://www.infrastructurereportcard.org/a/#p/bridges/investment-and-funding">ver 120 billion dollars</a> to fix our bridges. <a href="http://www.infrastructurereportcard.org/a/#p/bridges/overview">Budgets for future road repairs need</a> to be increased by 8 billion dollars per year. Despite the clear facts, politicians have done just the opposite.  As the graph I open my blog post with shows, spending on infrastructure has actually decreased during the ongoing recession.</p>

<p>To supplement and complete infrastructure investment the federal government should enact a Works Progress Administration style jobs push. The government should pledge to hire anyone willing and able to work at minimum wage and put those hired to work on public projects, including infrastructure improvements.This program should continue even after unemployment is lowered to regular levels. A major push on infrastructure will create many jobs and many workers will be hired to complete the construction work. The current high level of unemployment shows that there is much surplus economic  capacity able to be put to work.</p>

<p>In a depressed economy the United States government can increase spending without the need for increased taxation or other ill effects. The deficit is not a limiting factor for government investment. A country with its own, floating, non-convertable (a currency where the issuer does not pledge to convert currency for a commodity on demand) currency is not constrained in its government spending by absolute debt or deficit levels. The<a href="http://neweconomicperspectives.org/2012/01/mmp-blog-31-functional-finance-monetary.html"> only constraints on spending are the effects that the spending has on inflation, unemployment, demand</a> and other economic outcomes.</p>

<p>Any complaints that the debt would be increased by infrastructure improvements are not grounds to let our roads and bridges rot. There are many needed infrastructure improvements. The government should start on them as soon as possible.</p>
