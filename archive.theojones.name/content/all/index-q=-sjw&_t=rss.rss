<p><a href="http://www.theojones.name/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/socialjustice.jpg"><img src="http://www.theojones.name/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/socialjustice.jpg" alt="socialjustice" width="1000" height="800" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2439"></a>The above image is a collage of three of the top results on Flickr for a search of the phrase "Social Justice". The <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sully_aka__wstera2/4478077831/">top-left image is from user wstera2 </a>and is titled "When liberals are losing a debate". The top right image is from user Takver and is titled "C<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/takver/5415825802/">hange, Freedom, Social Justice - Egypt Uprising protest</a>". The bottom image is titled "<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/rikkis_refuge/16400696138/">World Day for Social Justice</a>" and is via user Rikki's Refuge.</p>

<p>By its self, the phrase "social justice" is pretty meaningless. The phrase is effectively equivalent to the word "fairness". Try taking an article that uses the phrase and swapping out all occurrences of "social justice" for fairness. Very little meaning will be lost.    But "fairness" is an arbitrary concept. Almost every political ideology will perceive their goals as "fair".  Phrases like "social justice" are the political equivalent of "maximizing synergies" business speak. Such concepts are almost entirely dependent on ideology. What one will perceive as "fair" or "just is largely subjective in global terms. Every major political ideology has a different conception of the public good. Libertarians regard markets as properly "fair", others regard egalitarianism as "fair", and others take a roughly utilitarian perspective of the greatest good for the greatest number as "fair". However, the concept is still subjective.  In regards to talk of "fairness" in economic policy, <a href="http://blog.dilbert.com/post/102964895406/fairness-test">Scott Adams (the author of the Dilbert cartoon) made a similar point</a>. "<em>fairness is a concept invented so dumb people can participate in debates. Fairness isn't a natural law of the universe. It's a psychological problem. We sometimes get fairness confused with equality. Equality is usually good, and can often be measured with a satisfying precision. Fairness, on the other hand, is usually just a rationale for some sort of bias ….It's just a psychological phenomenon that is easily manipulated.</em>"</p>

<p>However, there is one case where the phrase "social justice" carries more meaning than the word "fairness". The only meaning that is conveyed by that term is signaling about the speaker. Only certain ideologies refer to their goals as maximizing social justice. This gets us to pejoratives like "SJW".  So when a gater rants about "SJWs" they are attacking the ideologies refer to their goals as maximizing social justice. However, SJW is a strong pejorative. Using it is like saying "M$" in a discussion about Windows 10. It removes any indication that you are processing facts in a rational way and indicates that confirmation bias is at work. It's an inherently mocking tone, one that should only be used with clearly unreasonable positions. And treating reasonable positions as unreasonable destroys one's credibility.</p>

<p><img align="right" src="http://www.theojones.name/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/012115_0533_Meetthe8cha12.jpg" alt=""><span style="font-size:14pt">8chan is a forum website where anyone can create a sub forum, or "chan". Its one defining  feature is its friendliness to trolls, and its extremely lax , anything goes moderation policy. Among the more notable members of this community are a large part of the active members of <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/GamerGate" class="p-category" rel="tag">#GamerGate</a>, focused around the /<a href="http://8ch.net/gamergate/index.html">gamergate</a>/ board. However, there is a much more nefarious board, /<a href="http://8ch.net/baphomet/index.html">baphomet</a>/. That board has the purpose of a clearing house for doxing, harassment, trolling, and hacking. Its members care little for trivial things like ethics. The rules for the board note that "If you have remorse for you're  [sic] actions you are not welcome ….We never show mercy during raids " and  "so if you're a attention whoring faggot this is not the place for you".  /Baphomet/ was founded by trolls and script kiddies saddened by the switch of focus of the hacking group Anonymous towards activism and away from nefarious destruction. Many members of the /gamergate/ chan are also /Baphomet/ users.  There is a close relationship between the two boards. /gamergate/ is the clean board that provides a respectiable public image for GG. /Baphomet/ has become the home for GG dirty tricks. Want to know what GG is really like? Lets  look into /baphomet/ a bit more <a href="http://8ch.net/baphomet/index.html"></a><a href="http://8ch.net/baphomet/index.html">http:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>8ch.net/<wbr></wbr>baphomet/<wbr></wbr>index.html</a> Note that /baphomet/ is just behind /gamergate/ on the top 25 list of 8chan fora. The top thread is this guy<br /></span></p>

<span style="font-size:14pt">Oooh... Cool. Terrorizing SJWs. Let's open that thread. 
</span></p><p style="margin-left: 36pt"><span style="font-size:14pt"><strong><em>&gt;We need to develop beyond ddos<br />I agree, OP.<br />Doxing, Raiding, and DDOS are fine– but every "battle" we're currently enduring would be over by now if at least some of us knew how to hack/crack/program<br /><br />Currently, I only know (x)html(5) & css(3). [and some c++, but not enough to really do anything with…]
</em></strong></span>


 

<span style="font-size:14pt">I would like to be more of a menace to SJWs, but I'm a kidiot loser who doesn't know how to program anything more complex than a VBA macro. Some are making more progress on the whole being criminals thing. 
</span></p><p style="margin-left: 36pt"><span style="font-size:14pt"><strong><em>If you haven't noticed, a couple targets got their servers rooted (one hasn't noticed yet) and few got their mail hacked too (most haven't noticed, last time I checked).
</em></strong></span>

<span style="font-size:14pt">The 8chaners hacked the email of some activists trying to voice their opinion. Crushing free speech is something that really warms the heart, doesn't it? 
</span>


 </p><p style="margin-left: 36pt"><span style="font-size:14pt"><strong><em>You are free to fuck with colleges if you're so inclined. /baphomet/ has no particular cause or position on any given issue besides the position that we should raid people we want to raid because we think it's funny to do so. There have been debates about whether or not we're just pretending like we don't have a purpose, but ultimately it doesn't matter.
</em></strong></span></p><p style="margin-left: 36pt"><span style="font-size:14pt"><strong><em>This is first and foremost a haven for old, even ancient anons who remember what Anonymous was a decade ago and are reviving–as best we can–that same spirit. We are not political in any sense. If /pol/ would like to raid a target, /pol/ ought to raid a target. If it will be particularly funny, they're welcome to come ask us to help out, but if it looks like it's going to be a bore, or if it isn't funny but is simply a matter of supporting an abstract cause, this isn't really the place for it.
</em></strong></span></p><p style="margin-left: 36pt"><span style="font-size:14pt"><strong><em> ….
</em></strong></span></p><p style="margin-left: 36pt"><span style="font-size:14pt"><strong><em>We don't care about SJWs for the sake of ideology, we raid them because they're easily offended and react with sob stories. That they overwhelmingly are deserving of raids is beside the point.
</em></strong></span></p><p style="margin-left: 36pt"><span style="font-size:14pt"><strong><em>However, if you can find a lelworthy way to fuck with schools, go ahead and share.
</em></strong></span>

<span style="font-size:14pt">We don't really have a mission, other than being criminals that destroy things. 
</span></p><p style="margin-left: 36pt"><span style="font-size:14pt"><strong><em>A /baphomet/ take on the LOIC seems like the right way to go, in my opinion.<br />If there ever WAS a /baphomet/-endorsed DDoS client, I think it would need to be able to help resolve the common retarded mistakes that occur with planned ddossing; timezones, primary/secondary targets, fallbacks for meetups if everything turns to shit, etc.<br />My suggestion would be thus:<br />The new LOIC would only be able to function if it was connected to a host, ie the raid leader's own little server, who could update the variables (such as countdown timer, specific URLs, the required number of clients attacking each IP address so maximum DoS occurs across a few places, I dunno…) on people's clients (I'm thinking that the client should be alerted if the leader changes a variable, but they'd have to be edited by the user manually. I don't really want to just surrender my PC to a botnet that could be aimed at ANYTHING…) if/when they changed (by working in conjunction with the driving force of the raid in IRC, ie people from /baphomet/).<br />Being able to generate a session should require an additional piece of software to act as a barrier to fucktards, that newfag idiots would be too retarded to find / too shitscared to download if they found it. That would leave the important shit in the hands of people who actually cared about it, while allowing anyone to join the public botnet (but not fire until the countdown timer hit 0 / other parameters were met)<br />This would allow widespread advertisement of the raid and new LOIC to anywhere that would listen, generating a large group of people all under the 'guidance' of /baphomet/, or a proxy group such as 4chan's /b/ for max lulz and 0 blame<br />Sorry if this makes no sense, I'm slightly very drunk. Anyway, I seem to recall Anonymous using something like this a few years back, but I don't know enough about this shit to be able to pass judgement. Regardless, I think the best way for us to actually advance ourselves as social justice warrior warriors is to gain the (unknowing) support of others.<br />Side note, would it be possible to encourage SJWs into ddossing what they thought was 8chan with a program like I suggested, but really have them hit their own shitty sites? We could then post proof to the owners / domain providers for lulz
