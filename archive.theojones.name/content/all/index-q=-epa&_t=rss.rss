<p><i><a href="https://theojones.name/blog-post-series-on-the-history-of-sustainable-energy-and-climate-change-politics/">This is part of a blog post series on climate change.</a></i>In this post I am using a new way of doing citations that I will use in some of my longer posts. The citations can be found at the end notes/</p>

<p>The opposition to the development of nuclear energy was probably one of the worst mistakes the movement has ever made. A rapid conversion to nuclear energy in the 1970s – like the one France did – would have vastly reduced greenhouse gas emissions. France’s per capita greenhouse gas emissions (mostly due to cars, and heating fuel) is substantially less than the EU average, and a little over a third of the GHG emissions of the United States.

<p>sources have higher environmental impact than nuclear due to the large levels of natural resources needed to make wind and solar collectors, and due to the land-use of renewable sources. Nuclear is at cost parity with fossil fuels (even unsubsidized), while renewable still cost substantially more than traditional sources. The environmental opposition to nuclear energy has largely come out of two places. 1) the opposition to nuclear weapons (note the ”peace” in ”Greenpeace”), 2) a general technophobia. I will discuss both of these trends in this section. The relation between opposition to nuclear weapons, and the opposition to nuclear energy certainly exists for Greenpeace. The group was founded in part to oppose a nuclear weapons test on the Alaskan island of Amchitka. There were some concerns that this test could trigger geologic events like earthquakes or tsunamis. Greenpeace eventually formed out a group of (mostly Quaker) protesters opposing this event. Some of their tactics were opposed by established environmental groups – like the Sierra Club. Greenpeace’s website declares that <i>”motivated by their vision of a green and peaceful world, a small team of activists set sail from Vancouver, Canada in an old fishing boat. These activists, the founders of Greenpeace, believed a few individuals could make a difference... Amchitka was the last refuge for 3,000 endangered sea otters, and home to bald eagles, peregrine falcons, and other wildlife.”</i>[2].After this fissure with the environmental movement they eventually formed their own organization. Even today Greenpeace’s states that their mission includes the following goal ”<i>Working for disarmament and peace by reducing dependence on finite resources and calling for the elimination of all nuclear weapons.</i>” [3]. The group has even recently been involved in anti-war protests. In June of 2014 the group conducted a protest against NSA surveillance, and the construction of a new NSA data center [4]. Greenpeace is opposed to civilian nuclear energy and considers nuclear energy as a potential source of nuclear proflarition. They argue that the ability of nuclear energy to mitigate climate change is minor. They argue that the energy source has a high risk of accident, argue that nuclear energy has strong environmental impacts, and that nuclear energy is plagued by slow construction times, and dramatic cost overruns. They also argue that it competes with renewable energy for funding. I will discuss the ability for nuclear energy to mitigate climate change elsewhere, – in short it is very large. In fact it is possible to create a climate mitigation strategy that largely reilyes on nuclear energy. The construction times of nuclear energy are not a product of the technology but instead a product of the regulatory environment and finance. Nuclear energy construction times in France during the 1970s were around two years – similar to the construction times of renewable energy projects. Construction times in the U.S in the 50s and 60s were also around two years. There have been no major accidents at any of these projects. A major difference between these projects and modern ones is that these rapidly completed projects were generally publicly owned. Public or quasi-public ownership may be the preferable way to manage energy projects. With nuclear energy there is a general conflict of interest with the profit role and the public safety role. This produces a risk of an extrenality cost, and this is only mitigated by a expensive regulatory process. Public ownership avoids this conflict of interest. I would also argue that similar conflicts of interest have the potential to occur with renewable energy. There will be a large number of subsidies and government funding available to privately owned renewable energy firms, and it will be a tough regulatory challenge to provide that these funds are well-used. Later, I will discuss a proposal for quasi-public ownership of energy infrastructure that still allows for reasonable market pressure. In reality the opposition to nuclear energy has been one of the largest delays in the mitigation of climate change.</p>

<p>To the credit of Greenpeace, they have been one of the most vocal proponents of action on climate change. They call climate change ”the number one threat facing our planet”. They argue for a rapid mitigation of the threat. In their plan developed nation emissions would be reduced by 40 percent by 2020 and global emissions would be reduced to near zero. The group has also been a major contributor to activism on other environmental issues.<br />There is another source of opposition to nuclear energy. A general opposi tion of projects perceived to be non-”natural” over projects perceived to have a ”natural” basis. Even when the more ”natural” project is worse for the environment. This comes with a general embrace of pseudoscience within the more hardline elements environmental community, and a general opposition to technology. A lot of this conception of ”naturalness” comes from a vague perception of semi-vitalism – a belief that living/”natural” things have some property beyond their mere chemical composition. There is no scientific evidence for such a claim, but it is common/implied in arguments for ”alternative” (read: useless) medicine, organic foods (the certification for these foods is a mix of things that do some good, and things that are net harmful), opposition to the use of pesticides (which often net help the environment by reducing land use) and other issues. This perception, I believe, is at the core of a lot of the opposition to technological innovations among environmental groups. This is the most clear in the arguments against GMO crops.<br />The claims made by the campaigners against genetically modified foods are simply absurd. This ideology’s claims about the health effects of GMOs are as discredited in the scientific community as creationism or global warming denialism and all major scientific associations of repute that have looked into the issue disavow it. Their position that a compound can suddenly become toxic when synthesized due to a genetic modification of a plant, but is not toxic when synthesized by a natural process violates the laws of physics, chemistry and biology (It is worth noting that the BT toxin – a common product of genetic modification – is also a commonly used pest control in organic food, due to the fact that it is produced in the bacterium <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i>) Their understanding of the economics of these products is not much better. These compounds have passed the approval of the FDA and the EPA. our food is not being poisoned by Monsanto (or the Illuminati, or whoever else the people at Natural News are blaming today). While Monsanto and its ilk have business practices that are very good, the same can be said of major players in almost every industry in the world. In my opinion this ”movement” is just dressed-up ludditeism – both in the modern sense of general technophobia, and in the sense of the historical Luddite movement’s belief that the abuses of sweatshops were an inevitable outcome of the automation of textile production.<br />Technophobia is a core undercurrent of the anti-GMO ideology. When you read their discussions about ”frankenfoods” (of course ignoring the fact that almost all domesticated plants and animals differ greatly from their wild relatives) they are employing the idea that new technology is inherently bad and dangerous, while the ”natural” is inherently good and safe. Nothing of the kind is true. Technology has a great ability to improve our standard of living and there are many things that ”natural” Of course there are also harmful synthetic products.I put the word ”natural” in quotes because man-made things and ”natural” products are created by the same laws of physics. In reality,<br />everything in this universe is natural. To the anti-GMO activist, ”natural” just means created with recently invented technology and this technology is scary.<br />Like the historical Luddites who blamed technology for the ills of the textile industry, when these issues were really created by unethical business practices,anti-GMO activists claim that the bad behavior of business is the unavoidable result of technology. These activists (rightly) criticize the patent litigation of Monsanto. However, instead of seeing this as another symptom of a broken patent system, they inexplicably blame the technology. These activists (rightly) see a greedy monopolist in Monsanto but they blame the technology instead of calling for anti-trust reform. This attitude will only serve to hold back the progress made possible by technology, without dealing with the systemic issues that allowed these unethicalbusiness practices. Rest assured that even without GMO foods, these economic issues will continue to wreak havoc in other sectors of the economy.A common third way approach to the GMO issue is labling. Now I will discuss why GMO labeling is a terrible idea. There is no scientific basis to fear GMO products.The claimed consumer choice benefits of mandatory labeling can be fulfilled by private certifications and currently existing, government ran certification programs.Due to the dynamics of food markets, mandatory GMO labeling amounts to a defacto GMO ban. This will increase food prices and possibly add to the environmental damage cause by agriculture.The World Health Organization notes ”GM foods currently available on the international market have passed risk assessments and are not likely to present risks for human health”.The American Association for the Advancement of Science concluded that ”Several current efforts to require labeling of GM foods are not being driven by any credible scientific evidence that these foods are dangerous” and that ”GM crops are the most extensively tested crops ever”.Their report also noted that labeling could mislead and falsely alarm consumers.<br />All of the claimed consumer choice benefits of GMO labeling can be done by voluntary certification. All products currently sold as organic in the U.S lack GMO products. Private certifications are also very good at assuring that products are prepared in accordance to standards that are sufficient for their consumers. Note that there are many private companies which certify kosher products. Economies of scale in food production make it inefficient and cost prohibitive for companies to create separate product lines with GMO and non-GMO foods. Therefore, just one of these options will be taken.If the labeling causes a substantial minority of the population to avoid GMO foods then these foods will be forced off the market for everyone. This has already happened in Europe, where GMO labeling is mandatory. In fact, the push for labeling by the anti-GMO movement is just a pretext to regulate these products out of existence.This will harm consumers and the environment because GMO products require less land usage than their competitors. The price of this extra land will be passed on to consumers, along with the price of increased crop loss. This increased land usage will also have substantial environmental impacts. However, there will be no clear economic benefits to this defacto ban on GMO foods.</p>

Technology has a great ability to improve our standard of living and there are many things that "natural"   Of course there are also harmful synthetic products.I put the word "natural" in quotes because man-made things and "natural" products are created by the same laws of physics. In reality, everything in this universe is natural. To the anti-GMO activist, "natural" just means created with recently invented technology and this technology is scary.</p>

<p>Like the historical Luddites who blamed technology for the ills of the textile industry, when these issues were really created by unethical business practices, anti-GMO activists claim that the bad behavior of business is the unavoidable result of technology. These activists (rightly) criticize the patent litigation of Monsanto. However, instead of seeing this as another symptom of a broken patent system, they inexplicably blame the technology. These activists (rightly) see a greedy monopolist  in Monsanto but they blame the technology instead of calling for anti-trust reform. This attitude will only serve to hold back the progress made possible by technology, without dealing with the systemic issues that allowed these unethical business practices. Rest assured that even without GMO foods, these economic issues will continue to wreak havoc in other sectors of the economy.</p>
