<p><img align="left" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2015/01/011315_0655_ReligionsSh1.jpg.html" alt=""><span style="font-size:14pt">With the aftermath of the shootings at the office of the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, there seems to be a number of people on social media, and on <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/01/10/1356555/-On-not-being-Charlie">left-wing websites like Daly Kos</a> who seem to think the religion should be beyond criticism and mockery. One thing to note, is that contrary to what many of our friendly social justice warriors have said (Yes, I know that talking of SJWs gets a strong response, but that phrase contains the right level of derision for this dumb idea),the magazine in question is not an extremist or racist one and is well within the mainstream of French politics. The magazine has received many awards for its work and its authors are <a href="http://www.cpj.org/blog/2015/01/charlie-hebdo-attack-unites-france-on-free-express.php">well known and respected within the French journalism community</a>.  As the image to the right shows, the mockery towards religion published by those journalists is nondenominational as many major religions get their dose of mockery from Charlie Hebdo. Perhaps it is true that the authors were trolling Islamic extremists to some extent by publishing cartoons of the Prophet. But that does not make the magazine unacceptably racist. Instead of in opposition to racism, but many of the critics the magazine are instead proposing is that religion should be immune from criticism. That religion is something above other ideologies of beliefs should be treated specially. Religion is treated as some type of immutable characteristic of a person like sex or race. Therefore is street is something that is beyond criticism that any dislike of a given religion amounts to bigotry. This is the same sentiment that got political comedian Bill Maher into trouble after criticizing the growth of Islamic extremism in Europe. The thing is religion should not be treated differently than any other community or ideology or belief system. A religion is just an ideology and belief system with sky fairies. Perhaps it is true that criticism of Islam gets used as a cover for actual anti-Arab racists but, that does not mean that there is no such thing as legitimate criticism of the religion and the rising extremism within it. It is also true that rising immigration into Europe from many authoritarian countries has created new type of resident of Europe, and has created a population of many people dispute fundamental tenants of free and democratic society. <a href="http://www.inquisitr.com/1743767/bill-maher-refuses-to-lay-off-islam-slings-more-insults-on-his-own-show/">As was noted in the controversial edition of Bill Maher's show</a>, almost a quarter of British Muslims believe that the government should execute individuals who have converted away from Islam. This type of extremist ideology certainly deserves all the mockery in criticism that can receive. However many people prefer to deny that it exists at all. These people prefer to believe that terrorism is due to a few lone wolf extremists. Islam in general deserves some criticism for creating an environment where extremism is part of the mainstream. It's a lot like the <a href="../../tag/GamerGate.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#GamerGate</a> stuff I have discussed earlier in this blog. It's clear that an unusual amount of sexism in toxicity has come from the gaming community compared to other similarly sized Internet communities. And likewise is clear that Islam produces lot more extremism than other major world religions. As Bill Maher put it on a recent episode: <em>"Obviously, the vast majority of Muslims would never do anything like this, But they share bad ideas. This is the thing that caused the big ruckus when Ben Affleck was here. Sam Harris said, 'Islam is the motherlode of bad ideas,' and everyone went fucking nuts on this side of the panel. But it is. These two guys who shot up the cartoonists the other day, they were avenging the prophet, they said? A bad idea. Martyrdom? A bad idea. Women as second-class citizens? A bad idea. And unfortunately, the terrorists and the mainstream share a lot of these bad ideas.</em>" People rightfully saw the error in buuut…  <a href="../../tag/NotAllGamers.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#NotAllGamers</a>. Sure there are plenty of gamers who are not sexist trogs, but their community is a magnet for problem types. Now see the same with religion. </span></p>

            </h2>
                    <p class="reading">
                <span class="vague">9 min read </span>
            </p>
            <p>Earlier this month the European Court of Justice reached a verdict in the case <em>Google Inc v. Mario Costeja González, </em>and found that search engines have an obligation to remove search results about an person in some cases when the results are "linked to his name by a list of results displayed following a search made on the basis of his name", and "causes prejudice to the data subject". That is companies, such as the respondent Google, may have to allow people to curate the results that appear when they are googled. However, many media reports including some media sources in both Europe and in America have missed many critical factors in this ruling.  While this ruling has the potential to cause quite a bit of damage and brings with it very severe censorship risks, its potential impact has been overstated by many sources. In this post,  I will give an overview of this ruling, a discussion of its potential impacts and a background of European privacy law. Before I start I want to note two very fundamental differences between European law and United States law, 1) In the EU legal precedent does not form binding law and EU courts are not bound to follow their past rulings like American courts and European statutes have ultimate primacy , 2) while U.S privacy law largely focuses on protection from government intrusion, in the E.U privacy protections also strongly apply to private actors.</p><p>The text of the opinion (translated from Spanish) can be found at the following link.</p><p><a href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf%3Bjsessionid=9ea7d0f130d57c95e8e65fc04b72a024d865f42c61cf.e34KaxiLc3eQc40LaxqMbN4OaNmNe0?text=&amp;docid=152065&amp;pageIndex=0&amp;doclang=EN&amp;mode=req&amp;dir=&amp;occ=first&amp;part=1&amp;cid=277844"></a><a href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf%3Bjsessionid=9ea7d0f130d57c95e8e65fc04b72a024d865f42c61cf.e34KaxiLc3eQc40LaxqMbN4OaNmNe0?text=&amp;docid=152065&amp;pageIndex=0&amp;doclang=EN&amp;mode=req&amp;dir=&amp;occ=first&amp;part=1&amp;cid=277844">http:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>curia.europa.eu/<wbr></wbr>juris/<wbr></wbr>document/<wbr></wbr>document.jsf;jsessionid=9ea7d0f130d57c95e8e65fc04b72a024d865f42c61cf.e34KaxiLc3eQc40LaxqMbN4OaNmNe0?text=&docid=152065&pageIndex=0&doclang=EN&mode=req&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=277844</a></p><p><strong>Europe's Top Court?</strong></p><p>A lot of media sources covering the case have called the European Court of Justice Europe's highest court. While this is reasonable, it is also a bit of an oversimplification. Europe really has two supreme courts. The European Court of Justice (ECJ), and the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR). Even though the <em>González</em> case came before the ECJ  both courts touch on privacy issues, and understanding the history of both is critical to grasping EU privacy law. And even though they are co-equal courts with no clear way to resolve any conflict that may arise between them, the two courts rarely contradict each other.The ECJ handles litigation that comes up under European Union law. These include legislation passed by the European Parliament (some of which was the basis of the <em>González</em> case), and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (also involved in the case).</p><p>The ECtHR is limited to enforcing a single treaty, the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), a treaty which forms the basis of Europe's civil liberties and civil rights law. The treaty and the court are separate from the EU but all members of the European Union are parties to the Convention, and subject to the court's jurisdiction. The convention and the court have also been joined by non-EU states, including Switzerland, Turkey, and Russia. Even though the ECJ does have jurisdiction on many human rights law related issues (such as those brought up ), the ECtHR is usually the hot bed of such litigation.</p><p><strong>Privacy and Free Speech Law in Europe </strong></p><p>To a large degree the González case is about the trade-off between privacy and free speech. As we will see, Google is on the wrong end of this trade off as far as the European courts are concerned. European law is highly protective of privacy but all too willing to throw freedom of speech under the bus. The European privacy law critical to the <em>González</em> case was the Data Protection Directive passed by the European Parliament  (Directive 95/46/EC to be exact).This was passed to enforce the European Convention on Human Rights' privacy protections, and other law protecting privacy.  This law gives European citizens vast powers to control the collection and use of their personal data. In particular the directive provides that</p><p><em>‘1. Member States shall provide that personal data must be:</em></p><p><em>(a) processed fairly and lawfully;</em></p><p><em>(b) collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a way incompatible with those purposes. Further processing of data for historical, statistical or scientific purposes shall not be considered as incompatible provided that Member States provide appropriate safeguards;</em></p><p><em>(c) adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the purposes for which they are collected and/or further processed;</em></p><p><em>(d) accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that data which are inaccurate or incomplete, having regard to the purposes for which they were collected or for which they are further processed, are erased or rectified;</em></p><p><em>(e) kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the data were collected or for which they are further processed. Member States shall lay down appropriate safeguards for personal data stored for longer periods for historical, statistical or scientific use.</em></p><p>Personal data is a broadly defined term</p><p><em>“personal data” shall mean any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (“data subject”); an identifiable person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identification number or to one or more factors specific to his physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural or social identity;</em></p><p>And so is processing of data.</p><p><em>“processing of personal data” (“processing”) shall mean any operation or set of operations which is performed upon personal data, whether or not by automatic means, such as collection, recording, organisation, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, blocking, erasure or destruction;</em></p><p>The "processing" of personal data is highly limited, and with some exceptions only allowed in cases where " <em>processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by the third party or parties to whom the data are disclosed, except where such interests are overridden by the interests [or] fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection under Article 1(1).</em>’</p><p>An important case pushing the limits of these protections came with the <a href="http://www.ippt.eu/files/2003/IPPT20031106_ECJ_Lindqvist.pdf" target="_blank"><em>Linqvist</em> case</a> (2003), where the ECJ found that the posting of an announcement that a church volunteer was ill on a church website violated the law -- and that the directive is consistent with free speech protections. As that case illustrates, the privacy protections provided by EU law are vast. The privacy rights found in other areas of EU law are similarly broad.  However, free speech protections in Europe are not.  While there are a few highlights in this law, such as <em>Lingens v. Austria</em> (1986) a case before the ECtHR which limited libel suits against journalists when they are criticizing politicians, and<em> Kokkinakis v. Greece</em> (1993) which protected the rights of Jehova's Witnesses to proselytize --  EU free speech law is generally vastly more limited than its American equivalents. Member states are given vast power to limit free speech when deemed in the public interest, and other interests are usually given priority over free speech. There is almost nothing like the First Amendment's almost unconditional prohibition of government censorship.</p><p><strong>The González Case </strong></p><p><em> Google Inc v. Mario Costeja González</em> started when González was upset that a record of the foreclosure of his home was the first result when his name was googled. He claimed that by placing this information in   their search results, and by allowing it to become the first result when his name was searched  Google was storing, publishing  and processing his personal information. As per the Data Protection Directive he wanted the right to have this data removed and filed a complaint against  Google and La Vanguardia, a newspaper publishing an article on the foreclosure, with a regulatory body.  The regulator did not find the newspaper in violation, but did find Google in violation. The case made its way to Spain's second highest court , the Audiencia Nacional, which then referred it to the ECJ. The ECJ agreed that Google was in violation and sated that the company has an obligation to remove personal information from search results in some cases. FIrst of all the information had to be "inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant", "linked to his name by a list of results displayed following a search made on the basis of his name", and of a nature that "causes prejudice to the data subject". Already multiple other individuals have filed requests from removal of information from search results. <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-27439194" target="_blank">According to the BBC</a> these include</p><p><em>A man who tried to kill members of his own family who has asked for links to a news article to be taken down <br />
A celebrity's child who wanted links to news articles about a criminal conviction removed <br />
A suspended university lecturer who asked for the removal of links to articles mentioning the disciplinary action <br />
A convicted cyberstalker who, after being cited in an article about cyberstalking law, wants links to it taken down <br />
An actor who has asked for links to articles about an affair he had with a teenager taken down <br />
A man convicted of running a tax scam who wants all links referencing the event removed</em></p><p>Due to the limited nature of the ruling, many of these requests can be expected to be rejected, as, these are less likely to meet the  "inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant" standard.</p><p>Cross-posted On Medium</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@theojones/df2fc36e9e58"></a><a href="https://medium.com/@theojones/df2fc36e9e58">https:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>medium.com/<wbr></wbr>@theojones/<wbr></wbr>df2fc36e9e58</a></p><p><a href="../../tag/ecj.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#ecj</a> <a href="../../tag/europetopcourt.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#europetopcourt</a> <a href="../../tag/europeanunion.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#europeanunion</a> <a href="../../tag/memberstates.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#memberstates</a> <a href="../../tag/old.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#old</a> <a href="../../tag/old.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#old</a> <a href="../../tag/uncategorized.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#uncategorized</a></p></div>                    </div>

<p>The Second Amendment does not forbid moderate gun regulations. While there is an individual right to keep and bear arms, both the history behind the Amendment and current legal interpretation does not make this right as broad and as absolute as freedom of speech and other civil liberties. This is because the Second Amendment created an individual right in order to serve a collective purpose. The framers of the constitution believed that an armed populace in near universal militia service was a vehicle to protect individual rights. While there is a right for individuals to keep and bear arms, some limits on this right are within the government's power.</p>

<p>The framers of the United States Bill of Rights planned a military system based around broad based service where most adult males were expected to serve in a militia. Gun ownership was to be part of this militia system. Individuals would keep their personal military weapon but be expected to participate in and be trained as part of the military service. This tying of national service and gun ownership created a system where gun ownership was common but not necessarily restriction free. The intent of the founders was to create a military and gun ownership system that would of been similar to the current Swiss system. The framers of the U.S Constitution were not uniformly opposed to standing armies, but believed that they were potentially dangerous and one way of containing this danger was universal service in militias and a therefore more limited standing army. In the founders' view a large militia with broad based service supplemented by a smaller standing army was the optimal military and the one best suited to preserve liberty. Additionally, the founders also viewed individual gun ownership outside of a militia as important to the public interest and as a necessary supplement to militia service.</p>

<p>The militia clause of the Amendment states the purpose of the Second Amendment but the "right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed" clause of the Amendment is the effective part of the amendment. The Amendment provided that "right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed" because an armed population and a "regulated militia" is "necessary to the security of a free state".</p>

<p>This history and the wording of the Second Amendment create make both the collective right view and the individual rights view of the Amendment partiality correct. But both views are too extreme and contain severe flaws. The Second Amendment created an individual right in order to serve a collective purpose. In the mind of the framers of the U.S Constitution an armed populace in near universal militia service was a vehicle to protect individual rights. Contrary to the collective rights view promoted by many gun control advocates there is an individual right to keep and bear arms. However, the pure individual rights view promoted by groups such as the National Rifle Association is also incorrect as many restrictions are permissible because wide spread gun ownership was viewed as a means to protect liberty and not a fundamental liberty in itself.</p>

<p>While there is a right for individuals to keep and bear arms, some limits on this right are within the government's power because the individual right portion of the Amendment can not be interpreted so broadly as to harm the public interest. The individual right to keep and bear arms should not be interpreted to provide an absolute right akin to freedom of speech or freedom of religion but should be instead interpreted to provide a weaker right.</p>

<p>Alexander Hamilton in <i>Federalist No. 29</i> explained both the utility of an nationally organized militia and how the formation of a militia relates to the general armament of the population (emphasis added).</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>It requires no skill in the science of war to discern that uniformity in the organization and discipline of the militia would be attended with the most beneficial effects, whenever they were called into service for the public defense. …. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">This desirable uniformity can only be accomplished by confiding the regulation of the militia to the direction of the national authority. ....<br /></span><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Little more can reasonably be aimed at with the respect to the people at large than to have them properly armed and equipped ; and in order to see that this be not neglected, it will be necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course of a year.</span></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However,in the Founders' view bearing arms had utility to the public outside just militia service. An armed population, especially one with high militia service created a decentralize way to protect liberty and to prevent the formation of an authoritarian regime. James Madison in Federalist No. 46 wrote</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Besides the advantage of being armed, which the Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation, the existence of subordinate governments,to which the people are attached, forms a barrier against the enterprises of ambition, more insurmountable than any which a simple government of any form can admit of. Notwithstanding the military establishments in the several kingdoms of Europe, which are carried as far as the public resources will bear, the governments are afraid to trust the people with arms. And it is not certain, that with this aid alone they would not be able to shake off their yokes. But were the people to possess the additional advantages of local governments chosen by themselves, who could collect the national will and direct the national force, and of officers appointed out of the militia, by these governments, and attached both to them and to the militia, it may be affirmed with the greatest assurance, that the throne of every tyranny in Europe would be speedily overturned in spite of the legions which surround it.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>While the second amendment protects individual gun ownership and prevents a complete gun ban , the rationale for protecting individual gun ownership is one based on protecting the collective interest. The Constitution does not forbid reasonable and necessary restrictions on the sale and distribution of firearms. This is consistent with current court rulings, which state that there is an individual right to keep and bear arms but allow for substantial limits on that right. The Supreme Court in the majority opinion in <i>District of Colombia vs Heller </i><i>(2008)</i> stated that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<i>Although we do not undertake an exhaustive historical analysis today of the full scope of the Second Amendment, nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.</i>”</p>
