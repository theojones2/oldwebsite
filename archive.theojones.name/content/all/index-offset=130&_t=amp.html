<p>It seems to my like a large part of many left/progressive movements are now undergoing a tendency to put solidarity with others sharing their viewpoints ahead of actual good policy. I have also noted a recent uptick in people from the left who think that attacking another member of the movement (even when he is wrong) is about as bad as opposing it outright.  You see this when members of the femminist community go out of their way to defend toxic members of their community (see this article for an example <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/users/2015/05/bahar_mustafa_at_goldsmiths_university_ironic_misandry_claims_its_first.html">http:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>www.slate.com/<wbr></wbr>articles/<wbr></wbr>technology/<wbr></wbr>users/<wbr></wbr>2015/<wbr></wbr>05/<wbr></wbr>bahar_mustafa_at_goldsmiths_university_ironic_misandry_claims_its_first.html</a> )You see this with environmentalists who wagon circle  on issues like GMOs when the facts indicate that the anti-GMO position is stupid.</p>

<p>The Tesla home battery has been getting a lot of attention. Will it resolve the intermittentcy problem for solar? Probably not. Its too expensive.<br /><a href="http://ideas.4brad.com/does-tesla-new-home-storage-battery-suggest-amazing-breakthrough">http:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>ideas.4brad.com/<wbr></wbr>does-tesla-new-home-storage-battery-suggest-amazing-breakthrough</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is very interesting because, at present, battery grid storage is not generally economical. The problem is the cost of the batteries. While batteries can be as much as 90% efficient, they wear out the more you use and recharge them. Batteries vary a lot in how many cycles they will deliver, and this varies according to how you use the battery (ie. do you drain it all the way, or use only the middle of the range, etc.) If your battery will deliver 1,000 cycles using 60% of its range (from 20% to 80%) and costs $400/kwh, then you will get 600kwh over the lifetime of a kwh unit, or 66 cents per kwh (presuming no residual value.) That’s not an economical cost for energy anywhere, except perhaps off-grid. (You also lose a cent or two from losses in the system.) If you can get down to 9 cents/kwh, plus 1 cent for losses, you get parity with the typical grid. However, this is modified by some important caveats:</p>

<p>If you have a grid with very different prices during the day, you can charge your batteries at the night price and use them during the daytime peak. You might pay 7 cents at night and avoid 21 cent prices in the day, so a battery cost of 14 cents/kwh is break-even.<br />You get a backup power system for times when the grid is off. How valuable that is varies on who you are. For many it’s worth several hundred dollars. (But not too many as you can get a generator as backup and most people don’t.)<br />Because battery prices are dropping fast, a battery pack today will lose value quickly, even before it physically degrades. And yes, in spite of what you might imagine in terms of “who cares, as long as it’s working,” that matters.</p>

<p>In issues like the "debate" over GMOs I've seen a pattern where extreme charity is given to the arguments of the antiscience side. Let's take a person who thinks GMOs cause health issues clearly, by the plain language of how he phrases things indicates that he thinks that method of genetic modification introduces the health risk. It's a blatantly absurd position. Genetic modification is a method to synthesize compounds. A chemical compound is the same thing the matter how it was synthesized. BT toxin from a GMO corn plant is unequivocally the exact same compound is BT toxin collected from <em>B. thuringiensis </em>bacteria. This is completely without doubt. For a chemical that have "memory" of how it was synthesized or its past would contradict a vast swath of physics, chemistry, and biology. However, it is quite common this type of debate for the other side to rephrase his argument away from the plain language of it but towards a more plausible but different argument. Those scientifically literate people will tend to interpret the statement not as what its plain language says of compounds having "memory" but will instead interpret it as some kind of a claim at BT toxin itself is dangerous. (Which is itself an extremely doubtful claim that contradict quite a bit of scientific research, and known mechanism of how the toxin works against insects) Of course, this cannot be what most of the GMO health risk types mean, as they have no objection to the use of <em>B. thuringiensis </em>bacteria and the toxin it produces in organic agriculture. They must mean the prime face absurd claim that chemical compounds remember their past. Why should anyone do this charitable interpretation of what they are saying? Me? I am now at the point where I assume people exposing crank viewpoints mean what they say and say what they mean. If you say something that's clearly in contradiction with a large swath of science, I'm going to assume very vastly ignorant,or  are engaging in outright science denialism. I think, reason why a lot of people reinterpret what crackpots have to say, is because the claims of antiscience types are so absurd they immediately assume no one could seriously mean them. But, there are vastly ignorant or deluded people out there. There are people who put their preconceptions before any reasonable logic. There are people who don't understand the basics of chemistry and physics. There are Luddite types that have an extreme knee-jerk opposition to technology. It's time to take them seriously.</p>

<p>The idea of companies that are ran by their employees has been getting some attention in the liberal blogosphere. Often this discussion comes with extreme hype about their promise. Take <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EnoughLibertarianSpam/comments/37cbxv/hey_you_earnest_socialists_has_this_ancap_got_a/">a recent thread on Reddit</a> where the topic came up. There are plenty of people who think that a shift to such a form of organization over the current corporate form will result in a vast improvement in regards to all sorts of political and economic issues. The claimed benefits are wide ranging. Some on that Reddit thread say that eliminate the types of conflicts of interest between business and the public that make regulation necessary, others say there'll be vast environmental benefits, while others happen to believe that a switch to worker owned cooperatives will be the end of unfair treatment by employers and will be a general boon to workplace safety. However, despite the enthusiasm for this idea, it is way oversold. The issue with much of current business occurs when there is no external constraint on the working of business that forces the actions of businesses to follow the interests of the population as a whole. Will cooperatives change this? Probably not. The switch to cooperatives would change the beneficiaries of a company's actions, and the people get to choose the actions of the company, from the shareholders to the employees. However, nothing in economics provides any guarantee that the interests of the average employee of a company will be any more in line with the public purpose then the interests of the average shareholder. Although switch to employee cooperatives would change some issues, namely those that result from insufficient negotiating power on the side of employees, it would introduce new issues and leave many currently existing issues unresolved. The first big category of issues that worker cooperatives have little improvement on over traditional firms is externalities-a coal power plant ran as a cooperative will still have the same economic interests in polluting as a conventionally owned coal plant. The second major issue that cooperatives will be unable to resolve is a situation of economic rents-situations where due to monopoly or scarce resources a firm is able to get revenue that is far in excess of the actual cost of bringing a good into production. A worker owned firm will still want to collect the benefits of these economic rents, and disperse the profit to its members. There is also one major category where such cooperatives would be expected to perform worse than traditional firms, situations where increasing the average per employee revenue of a company is in conflict with increasing its overall productivity. A cooperative will not want to expand into potentially beneficial operations that produce less per worker the current business because there is a risk that such a thing will tend to force the share of the profits given to the incumbent members downward. A better alternative to worker owned cooperatives might be much more egalitarian ownership of conventional firms.</p>

<p>I hear a lot on the climate change issue about how technology will make adaptation much easier (usually from people who don't think drastic action should be taken on the issue). In the distant future (say, 100 years from now), to an large extent this is true. But its the close future (the next ~50 years or so) that we have to worry about. Sure, late in the 21st century or early in the 22nd century, a lot of innovations will serve to improve adaptation to climate change. Tech will decouple the economy from ecosystem services, space colonization will happen, and new, highly abundant energy sources will be developed (advanced fission reactors, fusion reactors, space-based solar). But that will take a long time to unfold, and in the meantime climate change will happen.</p>
