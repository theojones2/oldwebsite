        <p>Earlier this month the European Court of Justice reached a verdict in the case <em>Google Inc v. Mario Costeja González, </em>and found that search engines have an obligation to remove search results about an person in some cases when the results are "linked to his name by a list of results displayed following a search made on the basis of his name", and "causes prejudice to the data subject". That is companies, such as the respondent Google, may have to allow people to curate the results that appear when they are googled. However, many media reports including some media sources in both Europe and in America have missed many critical factors in this ruling.  While this ruling has the potential to cause quite a bit of damage and brings with it very severe censorship risks, its potential impact has been overstated by many sources. In this post,  I will give an overview of this ruling, a discussion of its potential impacts and a background of European privacy law. Before I start I want to note two very fundamental differences between European law and United States law, 1) In the EU legal precedent does not form binding law and EU courts are not bound to follow their past rulings like American courts and European statutes have ultimate primacy , 2) while U.S privacy law largely focuses on protection from government intrusion, in the E.U privacy protections also strongly apply to private actors.</p><p>The text of the opinion (translated from Spanish) can be found at the following link.</p><p><a href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf;jsessionid=9ea7d0f130d57c95e8e65fc04b72a024d865f42c61cf.e34KaxiLc3eQc40LaxqMbN4OaNmNe0?text=&docid=152065&pageIndex=0&doclang=EN&mode=req&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=277844"></a><a href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf;jsessionid=9ea7d0f130d57c95e8e65fc04b72a024d865f42c61cf.e34KaxiLc3eQc40LaxqMbN4OaNmNe0?text=&docid=152065&pageIndex=0&doclang=EN&mode=req&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=277844">http:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>curia.europa.eu/<wbr></wbr>juris/<wbr></wbr>document/<wbr></wbr>document.jsf;jsessionid=9ea7d0f130d57c95e8e65fc04b72a024d865f42c61cf.e34KaxiLc3eQc40LaxqMbN4OaNmNe0?text=&docid=152065&pageIndex=0&doclang=EN&mode=req&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=277844</a></p><p><strong>Europe's Top Court?</strong></p><p>A lot of media sources covering the case have called the European Court of Justice Europe's highest court. While this is reasonable, it is also a bit of an oversimplification. Europe really has two supreme courts. The European Court of Justice (ECJ), and the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR). Even though the <em>González</em> case came before the ECJ  both courts touch on privacy issues, and understanding the history of both is critical to grasping EU privacy law. And even though they are co-equal courts with no clear way to resolve any conflict that may arise between them, the two courts rarely contradict each other.The ECJ handles litigation that comes up under European Union law. These include legislation passed by the European Parliament (some of which was the basis of the <em>González</em> case), and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (also involved in the case).</p><p>The ECtHR is limited to enforcing a single treaty, the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), a treaty which forms the basis of Europe's civil liberties and civil rights law. The treaty and the court are separate from the EU but all members of the European Union are parties to the Convention, and subject to the court's jurisdiction. The convention and the court have also been joined by non-EU states, including Switzerland, Turkey, and Russia. Even though the ECJ does have jurisdiction on many human rights law related issues (such as those brought up ), the ECtHR is usually the hot bed of such litigation.</p><p><strong>Privacy and Free Speech Law in Europe </strong></p><p>To a large degree the González case is about the trade-off between privacy and free speech. As we will see, Google is on the wrong end of this trade off as far as the European courts are concerned. European law is highly protective of privacy but all too willing to throw freedom of speech under the bus. The European privacy law critical to the <em>González</em> case was the Data Protection Directive passed by the European Parliament  (Directive 95/46/EC to be exact).This was passed to enforce the European Convention on Human Rights' privacy protections, and other law protecting privacy.  This law gives European citizens vast powers to control the collection and use of their personal data. In particular the directive provides that</p><p><em>‘1. Member States shall provide that personal data must be:</em></p><p><em>(a) processed fairly and lawfully;</em></p><p><em>(b) collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a way incompatible with those purposes. Further processing of data for historical, statistical or scientific purposes shall not be considered as incompatible provided that Member States provide appropriate safeguards;</em></p><p><em>(c) adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the purposes for which they are collected and/or further processed;</em></p><p><em>(d) accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that data which are inaccurate or incomplete, having regard to the purposes for which they were collected or for which they are further processed, are erased or rectified;</em></p><p><em>(e) kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the data were collected or for which they are further processed. Member States shall lay down appropriate safeguards for personal data stored for longer periods for historical, statistical or scientific use.</em></p><p>Personal data is a broadly defined term</p><p><em>“personal data” shall mean any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (“data subject”); an identifiable person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identification number or to one or more factors specific to his physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural or social identity;</em></p><p>And so is processing of data.</p><p><em>“processing of personal data” (“processing”) shall mean any operation or set of operations which is performed upon personal data, whether or not by automatic means, such as collection, recording, organisation, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, blocking, erasure or destruction;</em></p><p>The "processing" of personal data is highly limited, and with some exceptions only allowed in cases where " <em>processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by the third party or parties to whom the data are disclosed, except where such interests are overridden by the interests [or] fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection under Article 1(1).</em>’</p><p>An important case pushing the limits of these protections came with the <a href="http://www.ippt.eu/files/2003/IPPT20031106_ECJ_Lindqvist.pdf" target="_blank"><em>Linqvist</em> case</a> (2003), where the ECJ found that the posting of an announcement that a church volunteer was ill on a church website violated the law -- and that the directive is consistent with free speech protections. As that case illustrates, the privacy protections provided by EU law are vast. The privacy rights found in other areas of EU law are similarly broad.  However, free speech protections in Europe are not.  While there are a few highlights in this law, such as <em>Lingens v. Austria</em> (1986) a case before the ECtHR which limited libel suits against journalists when they are criticizing politicians, and<em> Kokkinakis v. Greece</em> (1993) which protected the rights of Jehova's Witnesses to proselytize --  EU free speech law is generally vastly more limited than its American equivalents. Member states are given vast power to limit free speech when deemed in the public interest, and other interests are usually given priority over free speech. There is almost nothing like the First Amendment's almost unconditional prohibition of government censorship.</p><p><strong>The González Case </strong></p><p><em> Google Inc v. Mario Costeja González</em> started when González was upset that a record of the foreclosure of his home was the first result when his name was googled. He claimed that by placing this information in   their search results, and by allowing it to become the first result when his name was searched  Google was storing, publishing  and processing his personal information. As per the Data Protection Directive he wanted the right to have this data removed and filed a complaint against  Google and La Vanguardia, a newspaper publishing an article on the foreclosure, with a regulatory body.  The regulator did not find the newspaper in violation, but did find Google in violation. The case made its way to Spain's second highest court , the Audiencia Nacional, which then referred it to the ECJ. The ECJ agreed that Google was in violation and sated that the company has an obligation to remove personal information from search results in some cases. FIrst of all the information had to be "inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant", "linked to his name by a list of results displayed following a search made on the basis of his name", and of a nature that "causes prejudice to the data subject". Already multiple other individuals have filed requests from removal of information from search results. <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-27439194" target="_blank">According to the BBC</a> these include</p><p><em>A man who tried to kill members of his own family who has asked for links to a news article to be taken down <br />
A celebrity's child who wanted links to news articles about a criminal conviction removed <br />
A suspended university lecturer who asked for the removal of links to articles mentioning the disciplinary action <br />
A convicted cyberstalker who, after being cited in an article about cyberstalking law, wants links to it taken down <br />
An actor who has asked for links to articles about an affair he had with a teenager taken down <br />
A man convicted of running a tax scam who wants all links referencing the event removed</em></p><p>Due to the limited nature of the ruling, many of these requests can be expected to be rejected, as, these are less likely to meet the  "inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant" standard.</p><p>Cross-posted On Medium</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@theojones/df2fc36e9e58"></a><a href="https://medium.com/@theojones/df2fc36e9e58">https:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>medium.com/<wbr></wbr>@theojones/<wbr></wbr>df2fc36e9e58</a></p><p><a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/ecj" class="p-category" rel="tag">#ecj</a> <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/europetopcourt" class="p-category" rel="tag">#europetopcourt</a> <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/europeanunion" class="p-category" rel="tag">#europeanunion</a> <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/memberstates" class="p-category" rel="tag">#memberstates</a> <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/old" class="p-category" rel="tag">#old</a> <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/old" class="p-category" rel="tag">#old</a> <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/uncategorized" class="p-category" rel="tag">#uncategorized</a></p></div>]]></description>
