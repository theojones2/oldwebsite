<p>An article that shows why companies don't have to file tons of crap lawsuits to keep their trademarks.<br /><a href="http://blog.grabeh.net/The-myth-of-mandatory-trade-mark-enforcement">http:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>blog.grabeh.net/<wbr></wbr>The-myth-of-mandatory-trade-mark-enforcement</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Trade mark disputes pop up all the time. Often it's a David v Goliath affair with a large incumbent with an equally large legal budget seeking to squish to plucky start-up.</p>

<p>In some cases, the Goliath can attempt to use its registered trade marks to oppress an upstart providing goods or services in an area completely unrelated to it. </p>

<p>Some may see this kind of action as completely unreasonable on the basis that there couldn't conceivably be any confusion or intention to take advantage of the reputation of the incumbent.</p>

<p>Others might comment that a trade mark owner is required to enforce their trade marks otherwise risk losing the ability to enforce them in the future or as is sometimes mooted lose the trade mark altogether.</p>

<p>The government can't seize hotel records without due process. <br /><a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2015/06/city_of_los_angeles_v_patel_the_supreme_court_rules_that_police_can_t_simply.html">http:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>www.slate.com/<wbr></wbr>articles/<wbr></wbr>news_and_politics/<wbr></wbr>jurisprudence/<wbr></wbr>2015/<wbr></wbr>06/<wbr></wbr>city_of_los_angeles_v_patel_the_supreme_court_rules_that_police_can_t_simply.html</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a decision heralded as a big win for privacy rights, the U.S. Supreme Court decided, on 5–4 lines Monday morning, that the Fourth Amendment prevents the city of Los Angeles from enforcing a 116-year-old ordinance that compels hotel operators to turn over certain records to the police. In an opinion authored by Justice Sonia Sotomayor and joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Elena Kagan and Anthony Kennedy, the majority struck down the ordinance punishing hotel operators that refuse to turn over such records “without affording them any opportunity for pre-compliance review.” Justice Antonin Scalia penned a feisty rebuttal in response, accusing the majority of making it vastly more difficult for cops to break up drug rings, human trafficking, and prostitution operations.</p>
