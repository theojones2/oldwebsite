<p><a href="http://www.theojones.name/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/12212276953_f2f3530bb7_o-edited.jpg"><img class="  wp-image-2398 alignright" src="http://www.theojones.name/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/12212276953_f2f3530bb7_o-edited.jpg" alt="12212276953_f2f3530bb7_o-edited" width="293" height="267"></a>As you may have noticed, I have been working on a podcast feature for this blog. However, I am not hosting it on a podcast hosting service. Why? The cost of it isn't worth the benefit. I looked at some podcast hosts, such as <a href="http://libsyn.com">libsyn </a>and <a href="https://www.blubrry.com/">Blubrry</a>. These services have advocates (See, for instance <a href="http://theaudacitytopodcast.com/best-podcast-hosting-tap133/">http:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>theaudacitytopodcast.com/<wbr></wbr>best-podcast-hosting-tap133/<wbr></wbr></a>) but I think there are better alternatives. Now, it is true that regular webhosting is a very bad idea for podcasts. Web servers like Apache tend not to be designed for the types of large file downloads that podcasts bring and they often use hardware (like SSDs) that isn't suited for bulk storage of large files. My alternative to dedicated hosts is object storage services, like <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon's S3 </a>and Dreamhost's <a href="https://www.dreamhost.com/cloud/storage/">DreamObjects</a>. Objectors to this will note that they charge for bandwidth. But do the math. The cheapest feature-rich podcast hosting service that I am aware of is libsyn's $5 per month plan. It provides 50mb of hosting, but with unlimited bandwidth. DreamHost will sell you 40gb of storage (which is quite plentiful) for $0.95 with bandwidth at 5¢/GB. Amazon's prices are similar (I use dreamhost, but have no strong preference between the two services). How many users will you need to come out worse with DreamObjects? Quite a few. Lets say you use your full libsyn 50mb and your subscribers download everything you post. You pay $5. For comparison a DreamObjects user could afford storage plus 80gb of bandwidth. Under these assumptions a Dreamhost user could support 1,600 users before libsyn looks better. In fact, services like libsyn are able to support the few heavy users because the vast majority of their users use less than they pay. The great majority of their users support the few.</p>

      <title>On reducing blogging engine bloat.</title>

<p>I've switched between blogging engines a few times for this site (there are still some broken links and images from the transition). WordPress, what I'm on now, has a good bit of bloat. Simpler blogging engines, like Ghost, go too far in the other direction, and lack critical features.  I haven't been able to find a blogging engine that hits a good in-between. Personally, I feel that the way to hit that in-between in modularity.  The old UNIX Philosophy of "do one thing and do it well". Plugins are how modularity should be reached. Create a simple core blogging engine (the functionality level of Ghost would be a good target) and add the rest as optional plugins. Now, you might note that WordPress plugins often add a lot of bugs, have a lot of security holes, and are often written by people who don't know what they are doing. And you would be right. However, there is no reason why such plugins can't be maintained in the same source tree as the core software with the help of actual developers. Just put any frequently used plugin in the tree as an officially supported feature set. A user can also easily swap out the official implementation of a feature with an alternative.   This would provide the perfect mix of flexibility and simplicity.  It would allow more officially supported features but users who don't want a feature don't have to put up with the BS that comes with it.  This is a rough analogue of the development method of the classical UNIXes and the BSDs.</p>
