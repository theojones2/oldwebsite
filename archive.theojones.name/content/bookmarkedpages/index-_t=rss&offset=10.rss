    <blockquote><p>"Eventually I started to wonder about the recipients of our shamings, the real humans who were the virtual targets of these campaigns. So for the past two years, I’ve been interviewing individuals like Justine Sacco: everyday people pilloried brutally, most often for posting some poorly considered joke on social media. Whenever possible, I have met them in person, to truly grasp the emotional toll at the other end of our screens. The people I met were mostly unemployed, fired for their transgressions, and they seemed broken somehow — deeply confused and traumatized."</p></blockquote></div>

    <blockquote><p>"This can lead to unintended consequences. We may mean to say that words should be rebutted with other words rather than with official coercion, and that the best response to speech we don't like is more speech. But the words we choose can subtly promote the understanding that words are violent acts, and therefore something suitable for regulation."</p></blockquote></div>

    <blockquote><p>"Some scientists thought that, because of the way lizards retain heat to regulate their cold-blooded bodies, they might be more sensitive to temperature changes. Well, not in this case. The paper has been retracted from Ecography because the scientists erred in calculating the “radiative conductance of the animal” — basically, how much heat it can get rid of — such that the “broad-scale” conclusions of the study are invalid."</p></blockquote></div>

    <blockquote><p>"Besides, why stop at the CEO? If we’re going to demonize entire corporations based on the personal beliefs and ideologies of individual employees why not also boycott Boeing BA +1.52%, or Walgreens, or Intel INTC +3.33%, or Google GOOG +2.40%, or the State of California itself—all of which had employees who donated $1,000 in support of Proposition 8 just as Brendan Eich did? If you think $1,000 of support is heinous, you definitely shouldn’t support the Los Angeles Dodgers, or Merrill Lynch, or Allstate ALL +3.39%—each of which had at least one employee who donated $10,000 or more to the effort to pass Proposition 8."</p></blockquote></div>

    <blockquote><p>"The number of so-called “predatory” open-access journals that allegedly sidestep publishing standards in order to make money off of article processing charges has dramatically expanded in recent years, and three-quarters of authors are based in either Asia or Africa, according to a new analysis from BMC Medicine.* The number of articles published by predatory journals spiked from 53,000 in 2010 to around 420,000 in 2014, appearing in 8,000 active journals. By comparison, some 1.4-2 million papers are indexed in PubMed and similar vetted databases every year."</p></blockquote></div>

    <blockquote><p>"Here’s our favorite passage in “Variation in Melanism and Female Preference in Proximate but Ecologically Distinct Environments” (emphasis ours), published in Ethology: "Although association preferences documented in our study theoretically could be a consequence of either mating or shoaling preferences in the different female groups investigated (should we cite the crappy Gabor paper here?), shoaling preferences are unlikely drivers of the documented patterns both because of evidence from previous research and inconsistencies with a priori predictions"."</p></blockquote></div>

    <blockquote><p>"People asked why Apple uses the Command key for shortcuts, and not Control, even though there is a Control key present. I now attempt to explain. It's a bit of a brain dump, so sorry if it's a bit difficult to navigate. I'm not good at this sort of thing. There's some mildly interesting info in here, but in case of tl;dr: One of the Steves (probably Woz) wanted to be purist about the use of the Control key for generating control characters on the Apple IIe, so added a new key for use with application shortcuts, and the rest is history."</p></blockquote></div>

    <blockquote><p>"Now the story behind this case is considerably higher-profile than the ones I’ve written about before: The post that led to the order is at the heart of the so-called 'Gamergate' controversy, which some readers might be acquainted with. Eron Gjoni was briefly romantically involved with Chelsea Van Valkenburg, a computer game developer who used the pen name Zoe Quinn, and who I am told has recently changed her name legally to Zoe Quinn. (The case was entered into the court system under the name Van Valkerburg rather than Van Valkenburg or Quinn, so the briefs use Van Valkerburg.) After they broke up, Gjoni wrote a series of blog posts about Van Valkenburg, in which he accused her — whether or not accurately — of mistreating him in various ways during his relationship. This post in turn led to various accusations about supposed misdeeds in the video gaming industry, and various threats of violence against Van Valkenburg by people who have apparently taken Gjoni’s side."</p></blockquote></div>
