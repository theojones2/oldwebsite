<p>"I wish that Ronson had also considered why demanding that someone is fired from his or her job has become so central to the public shaming ritual. This demand, I think, reveals several things. First, it reflects how we are all public figures now and all have brands or reputations to protect, and so do our erstwhile employers. We have ported the logic of the celebrity shame cycle—in which corporate sponsors are expected to drop the offender posthaste—to the workaday world. It’s a strange conflation of the public and private, of believing that individuals are always-on representatives of their employers and that an incensed public is in a position to decide when this association should end."</p>

    <blockquote><p>"Today's college students came of age in the years after 9/11. What did we teach them about the balance between liberty and safety in that time? We should have taught them not to give up essential liberty for a little safety. Instead, we taught them that the government needs the power to send flying robots to kill anyone on the face of the earth without review and without telling us why. The government, we're told, needs to do that for our safety. We also taught them that the government also needs the power to detain people indefinitely without judicial review, again in the name of safety. We taught them that to ensure our safety the government needs the records of what books we read and who we talk to. With that as a model, it seems like small potatoes to say that safety requires disinviting Bill Maher from a university commencement, because he's something of a dick."</p></blockquote></div>

    <blockquote><p>"The “solutions” to drug violence permeate the law, and attitudes toward drugs, that grew out of the crack days, from the drug kingpin sentences reflected in the sentencing guidelines to in rem forfeiture, sold as “taking the profit out of crime.” These are monumentally serious issues, given that the number of murders in New York City in 2014 was 328. Clearly, something has changed, given that recent drug crime hasn’t produce a fraction of the violence. Does this matter? You bet it does. It’s critical that judges recognize that the perceived connection between drugs and violence from the bad old days is no longer true, and that defendants sentenced for drug offenses not be viewed through the prism of violence as well. But when the “scholarship” relies on such a mistaken premise, that violence never happened, it’s immediately dismissed."</p></blockquote></div>

    <blockquote><p>"If there’s one thing we’ve learned from the <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/Gamergate" class="p-category" rel="tag">#Gamergate</a> debate, it’s that people -- on both sides -- are being harassed. I’m not just referring to tweets and emails saying rotten things, but the leaking of personal information for everyone to see, also referred to as doxxing. Even before Gamergate, doxxing and swatting (filing a false report of a critical incident in which response units, including SWAT and bomb squads, are deployed) have been tactics used to harass people in the gaming community -- mostly pro gamers."</p></blockquote></div>
