      <description><![CDATA[<div>
        
<p>The Cato institute recently published an article titled <em><a href="http://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/carbon-tax-would-make-no-sense">A Carbon Tax Would Make No Sense</a></em> that represents many of the most common arguments made by climate change denialists. In this post I will do a analysis of why these arguments are wrong.</p>
<!--more--><blockquote>
<p>Do you know how much carbon dioxide is in the atmosphere? It is a little less than 400 parts per million. Do you know what the optimum level of carbon dioxide is? No one does, even though some have the extreme conceit to think they do.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is the optimal level of CO2. Any level between 250-350 parts per million.Climate change is harmful because of the rapid rate of temperature change it has caused, not the absolute level of temperature created. Ecosystems and human civilization have developed around a relitively stable climate since the last ice age. The current rate of change to this climate is almost unprecedented in the Earth's geologic history and every time a similarly rapid change has happened, the result has been a mass extinction and a widespread disruption of ecosystems. <a href="http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art32/main.html">A CO2 concentration at this level would stabilize</a> the climate at a level that is consistent with what ecosystems have evolved to handle and what human infrastructure is adapted to handle. The human economy is extremely dependent on this stable ecosystem. In fact it could be said that the economy is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the global ecosystem.These impacts will be disastrous for human health, agriculture and the economy. The 2007 IPCC assessment contains a excellent diagram that summarizes these impacts. <br /><a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/figure-spm-2.html"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The earth’s atmosphere is 78 percent nitrogen, about 21 percent oxygen, less than 1 percent argon, and only 0.038 percent carbon dioxide — plus a variable amount of water vapor. The gas is necessary for life. Plants cannot grow without it. .... There is evidence that as carbon-dioxide levels have risen, plants are growing faster, which means cheaper food.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A small amount of CO2 can do a lot as this video via <a href="http://climateplace.org">climateplace.org</a> shows</p>

<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/81FHVrXgzuA" height="360" width="480" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>

<p>First of all the claim <a href="http://www.skepticalscience.com/co2-plant-food-advanced.htm">that increased CO2 in the atmosphere will increase agricultural productivity is false</a>. Second, plants are also sensitive to temperature which means more expenive food. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>When fossil fuels are burned, they produce small amounts of carbon dioxide but large amounts of water vapor. Increases in water vapor show up as more cloud cover. Clouds both trap heat (which increases warming) and reflect sunlight (which reduces warming), but there is no consensus about which effect is greater.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Want to hear something that will rock your world? Climatologists know clouds exist and have taken them into account in their models.In fact, the IPCC report devotes <a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch1s1-5-2.html">a whole section</a> to the effect of clouds on the climate system. Oh wait not just one section <a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch8s8-6-3-2.html">but two sections</a>. The result of this research into the clould feedback is that clouds can have a significant effect of the climate system but don't even come close to being able to neutralize the effect of a CO2 increase.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is known with a high degree of certainty is that at times in the past, the Earth has been both warmer and cooler at current levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.skepticalscience.com/co2-higher-in-past-intermediate.htm">Compare CO2 levels for the past 500 million years to temperature. <br /></a> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is also known is the current climate models have a dreadful record of prediction.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Climate models have actually been very accurate. <a href="http://www.skepticalscience.com/Hansen-1988-prediction-advanced.htm">Compare Hansen's 1988 predictions</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Twenty years ago, we were told that the Earth’s temperatures would steadily rise from then on, yet there has been no average warming for the past 16 years — oops.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.skepticalscience.com/graphics.php?g=47">Bzzzt</a>! Looks like you still haven't had any luck at understanding climate science.</p>

<p>[caption id="attachment_569" align="alignright" width="1024"] One of the most common misunderstandings amongst climate change "skeptics" is the difference between short-term noise and long-term signal. This animation shows how the same temperature data (green) that is used to determine the long-term global surface air warming trend of 0.16°C per decade (red) can be used inappropriately to "cherrypick" short time periods that show a cooling trend simply because the endpoints are carefully chosen and the trend is dominated by short-term noise in the data (blue steps). Isn't it strange how five periods of cooling can add up to a clear warming trend over the last 4 decades? Several factors can have a large impact on short-term temperatures, such as oceanic cycles like the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) or the 11-year solar cycle. These short-term cycles don't have long-term effects on the Earth's temperature, unlike the continuing upward trend caused by global warming from human greenhouse gas emissions.

<blockquote>
<p>A carbon tax has real costs to the American economy. Energy prices and food prices would be higher, and virtually everything else that people consume would cost more. The results of higher prices are a lower standard of living, less economic opportunity, lower real wages and fewer jobs. All for what?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is of course why the Cato Institute thinks <a href="http://www.cato.org/blog/unfair-criticism-fair-tax">replacing the current tax system with a sales tax is a "pro-growth"</a> option.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As an economist, I make no pretense to knowing what the optimum temperature of the earth ought to be and what the optimal level of carbon dioxide should be.....</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then why tell policymakers to ignore the advice of an overwhelming majority of researchers in the natural sciences on the subject?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As an economist, though, I am prepared to make judgments as to whether a proposed tax is likely to have more benefits than costs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You seem to be doing this by assuming away the costs of climate change. <a href="http://economics.about.com/od/termsbeginningwith1/g/assume_a_can_opener.htm">Ever hear of the joke about when an economist, a chemist and a physicist got struck on an island</a>?" <em>A physicist, a chemist and an economist are stranded on an island, with nothing to eat. A can of soup washes ashore. The physicist says, "Let's smash the can open with a rock." The chemist says, "Let's build a fire and heat the can first." The economist says, "Let's assume that we have a can-opener..."</em> "</p>

<p><a href="http://pus.sagepub.com/content/early/2013/09/04/0963662513500196.abstract">A study published this month </a>in the journal Public Understanding of Science [1. León, Bienvenido, and Mª Carmen Erviti. "Science in pictures: Visual representation of climate change in Spain’s television news." Public Understanding of Science (2013): 0963662513500196.] looked at the relation of visual images to coverage of the global warming issue in Spain's television media.</p>

<p>[caption id="attachment_533" align="alignright" width="300"]<a href="http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/WorldOfChange/decadaltemp.php"></a> This images represents the causes of climate change. Image via NASA Earth Observatory[/caption]</p>

<p>The study found that "<em>the low rate of coverage of CC[Climate Change] can be related to the scarcity of attractive images available to the channels</em>".<!--more--> The authors looked at three issues; the extent to which the lack of images to illustrate global warming, the extent to which images used showcase the impacts of climate change rather than its causes and the extent to which images used represent climate change as a remote process. The research was done through a mix of analysis of television shows aired by Spain's major networks and interviews with journalists. The authors found that climate change is generally considered a niche topic and that scarcity of images is one core reason this is true. Of particular importance is the amount of original images available to networks. Furthermore the visual representation of impacts of climate change looms large in media coverage and can produce spectacular images. Images of climate change impacts are almost always focused on international matters such as the effects of global warming on polar bears. Images of local impacts are rare. The most common way to visually represent the causes of climate change is by showing an image of a smokestack. These representations have a tendency to make the climate change issue seem distant, remote, mundane and insignificant.</p>

<p>I think that the results of this study are related to the current state of climate change denialism. Those who try to ignore the human role in global warming have switched their focus away from arguing that it isn't happening to arguing that it isn't important. Conservative groups in the United States have tried to make it seem like climate change activists are just a bunch of tree huggers trying to save the polar bears at the expense of the economy. Portrayal in the media can bolster this impression when climate change gets portrayed as unimportant.</p>

<p>Nuclear energy is a fuel source that is far superior to the fossil fuels that our economy is currently based on. As I will show in this post  nuclear power produces lower greenhouse gas emissions, is safer and is cheaper than many fossil fuels.</p>

<p>[caption id="attachment_526" align="alignright" width="300"]<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Nuclear_Power_Plant_Cattenom_a.png"></a> Unlike fossil fuel power plants, the only substance leaving the cooling towers of nuclear power plants is water vapour and thus does not pollute the air or cause global warming.

<ol><li><strong>Lower Greenhouse Gas Emissions:  </strong>France with 73% of its power from nuclear has per-capita CO2 emissions three times LOWER then the U.S. Power costs in France are half that of Germany.</li>
    <li><strong>Health and Safety:</strong> The pollution produced by the fossil fuel industry kills more Americans every year than nuclear energy generation has in the entire world in all of history. <!--more-->A study of more than 400 coal power plants by the American Lung Association<a href="http://www.lungusa.org/about-us/our-impact/top-stories/toxic-air-coal-fired-power-plants.html"> found that the pollution from the power plants kill approximately 13,000 people a year</a> or about 20 people a power plant. <a href="http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fatomicinsights.com%2F1996%2F04%2Fchernobyl-health-effects-best-available-data.html&h=jAQH8I97P">The Chernobyl disaster killed 42 people.</a>What the nuclear industry calls their worst disaster in history the coal industry calls "clean coal". Fukushima and Chernobyl were light water reactors from the 1970s based on designs from the 50s. 95% of the radioactive material from Fukushima was contained and there were no fatalities. The failure of the Fukushima reactor was caused by a once in a lifetime magnitude 9.0 earthquake and a 45 foot high tsunami. Three similar but more modern reactors were hit by the same tsunami and earthquake and remained intact. The latest reactor designs can produce even better safety results. Generation III reactors such as Westinghouse Electric's AP1000, which are the most modern designs currently in production have a very small risk of accident.A report by British regulators found that the AP1000 has a less than 1 in ten million chance of undergoing an accident that results in reactor core damage. The risk of a similar failure from a fourth generation reactor design such as a lead-cooled fast reactor is near-negligible. <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2050039-1,00.html">These reactors can also breeder reactors that are much smaller and compact than light water reactors and require much less fuel. In these reactors liquid lead is used to cool the reactor and transfer heat instead of water.</a> These reactors can not produce enough heat to vaporize the lead and cause an explosion. If there is a fuel leak the escaped lead solution will quickly solidify. A lead-cooled fast reactor that can produce enough power for 17,000 households and the fuel needed to run it for over a decade can be the size of a household refrigerator (the equipment to control and monitor the reactor would be the size of a small factory) and kept underground and covered by enough steel and reinforced concrete to contain any failure.</li>
    <li><strong>Cost:</strong> Nuclear power is the cheapest clean energy source and is cost competitive with fossil fuels. <a href="http://www.energy.ca.gov/2007publications/CEC-200-2007-011/CEC-200-2007-011-SD.PDF">According to the California Energy Commission</a> without subsidies nuclear power costs 7.7 cents per kilowatt hour. Coal without subsidies costs 7.4 cents per kilowatt hour. Natural gas and oil cost more than nuclear without subsidies.</li>

<p>There is a initiative petition in Arizona to legalize marijuana.Its full text can be found on the website of Safer Arizona, the group organizing the initiative. <a href="http://legalizeaz.com/"></a><a href="http://legalizeaz.com/">http:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>legalizeaz.com/<wbr></wbr></a> has a list of locations where signatures are being collected. I have already had the opportunity to sign it</p>

<p><a href="http://www.azcentral.com/news/politics/articles/20130612personal-experience-spurs-effort-legalize-pot-recreational-use.html">From an article in the <em>Arizona Republic</em> on the the initiative.</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dennis Bohlke, the 59-year-old computer programmer who is leading the effort, said the Safer Arizona initiative is modeled after Colorado’s newly enacted law, which taxes and regulates marijuana.</p>

<p>“The intent of the initiative is to legalize marijuana in Arizona and to treat it as we treat alcohol,” said Bohlke.</p>

<p>The effort would amend the state Constitution to allow people 18 and older “to consume or possess limited amounts” of marijuana. The initiative would allow state officials to license grow facilities, marijuana stores and other facilities.</p>

<p>The initiative needs 259,213 valid signatures by July 3, 2014, to qualify for the November 2014 ballot.</p>

      <title>Pre-funding Energy Consumption: A Proposal to Encourage Energy Efficiency of Consumer Products</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div>
        
<p>It is clear that there is much that we can do to improve the energy efficiency of our economy. However, the main reason why these options are not deployed is consumers are unable to price and evaluate the future energy consumption of the products that they buy. Here I will propose a method of pre-funding energy consumption of consumer products. Under my proposal manufacturers of consumer, business and industrial electronics and appliances would be required to make an energy deposit based on the future energy consumption of their products. This deposit will be equal to the cost of the energy that the typical user of the product would pay over a typical product lifetime. The consumer could then redeem this energy deposit when they buy electricity or fuel.This proposal would provide consumers a clear signal of the value of the future energy consumption of their purchases. This is because the energy consumption would be part of the cost of purchase. The effect of this proposal on the pocketbooks of consumers would be minimal because the cost of the energy deposit would be rebated dollar for dollar to the consumer's future energy consumption.If consumers buy more efficient products as a result of this program then they will on the whole save money.Unlike alternatives, my proposal is a market-based way of encouraging energy efficiency. It works by making markets more efficient instead of telling consumers what they can buy. As far as I can tell no one has proposed this idea before. This blog post gives an overview of the justifications for this program. In later posts I will go deeper into these issues and provide more details on how pre-funding energy consumption would work.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The potential scale of energy efficiency improvements that can be made in the United States is vast. The United States is much less efficient in its energy usage than other industrialized nations. <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EG.USE.PCAP.KG.OE">According to the World Bank,</a> the average American uses about 300.91 GJ (83586 KWH) of energy per year. For comparison, the average resident of France uses a little over half that or 169.28 GJ per year.The following map depicts the differences of energy consumption between different countries.</p>

<p>[caption id="attachment_490" align="alignnone" width="530"]<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Energy-consumption-per-capita-2003.png"></a> Map Via Wikipedia and licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported license.[/caption]</p>

<p>It is possible that America could attain this type of energy efficiency in two decades.</p>

<p>Why haven't we achieved a more efficient economy already? One important reason is that consumers have imperfect information about energy usage.When buying a product consumers often have little knowledge about which is more energy efficient. Even when the energy usage of a product is labeled, it is difficult for a typical person to quantify this into a long term cost of ownership. How many consumers check how much money a 60 watt light-bulb will cost to run? How many even know how to conduct these calculations? Most likely very few. To run efficiently markets require consumers to have good information on what they are purchasing and how the product compares to alternatives. My proposal will solve this issue. The future cost of energy will be made immediately known to the consumer because it will show up on the price tag.The guesswork that consumers have to do to compare energy efficiency will be eliminated. A strong source of bias and inefficiency in the marketplace will be fixed.</p>

<p>My proposal is different than others which have been previously made as it relies on giving consumers and businesses a market signal without supporting particular options on the market. Consumers are allowed to apply other information they have and their knowledge of their exact circumstances to their product decisions. While the government should certainly use multiple methods to encourage energy efficiency my proposal may be best suited to form the core of an energy efficiency policy because of its market-based nature. Regulations that ban certain products act by taking choose away from consumers. When the government subsides a type of product it may be picking favorites, even when an even more cost effective energy efficiency option may be available.</p>

<p>I've been trying various methods to make this blog load faster and optimize WordPress. This post discusses some of what I found works and what I found didn't work.  <br />One of the first things I tried was W3 Total Cache which many bloggers . This plugin was able to reduce my page load times by about 1 sec, but I decided that it is more trouble than it is worth. It was incompatible with other plugins that I have been using, created issues with page loading and created other issues. If you do decide to use this plugin I recommend that you do not use the minify options as this functionality was in my experience the most likely to cause problems. Also, install the APC module for PHP (on Ubuntu apt-get install php-apc). APC makes the caching run more efficiently.The next thing I did was to reduce the "above the fold content" on my posts and put more of my post content below the read more button. This resulted in a home page that loaded faster. Previously I had the full content of my posts load on the front page, now I limit the part of my posts that show on the front page to the first paragraph.  <br /><!--more--></p>
<p>I then tried other plugins to make my WordPress faster.The WP-SmushIt is one that I recommend. It reduces the file size of the images that get sent to the readers' browsers. I also recommend Combine JS and Combine CSS which merge the Javascript and CSS files on your website. <br />
The next thing I did was minimize the external content that loads on this website.Each time you load a widget or image from an outside website you require the reader's browser to make a DNS request. I replaced the twitter widget with a link to my twitter. I also replaced embedded images that load from external websites with locally hosted images.</p><p><a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/apc" class="p-category" rel="tag">#apc</a> <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/css" class="p-category" rel="tag">#css</a> <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/dns" class="p-category" rel="tag">#dns</a> <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/old" class="p-category" rel="tag">#old</a> <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/old" class="p-category" rel="tag">#old</a> <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/uncategorized" class="p-category" rel="tag">#uncategorized</a> <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/w3totalcache" class="p-category" rel="tag">#w3totalcache</a></p></div>]]></description>

      <title>Why Our Drug Laws Need Reform and How to Carry Out the Reform</title>

<p><!--StartFragment--><a href="http://www.countthecosts.org/seven-costs/wasting-billions-drug-law-enforcement#%281%29">Current drug laws cost the global economy at least 100 billion dollars per year.</a> Imagine what we could do with that money if it were instead spent on something like healthcare, education, reducing non-drug crimes or alleviating poverty. Instead of spending this money on something that is useful to the nation we chose to spend it on an ineffective policy that increases crime and jams our courts and spreads disease. There is an alternative</p>

<p>[caption id="attachment_454" align="alignright" width="300"] A view of a neon sign of a cannabis coffee shop in Arnhem, The Netherlands .Image via Wikipedia and licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported license[/caption]</p>

<p>to this policy. I advocate the legalization of mild drugs such as marijuana and the decriminalization of hard drugs. This policy will treat marijuana like alcohol and tobacco and will treat the hard drugs such as cocaine as a public health issue instead of a criminal problem. If we decriminalize drug use the government will not continue to try to tell millions of people throughout this country what chemicals they can or can not voluntarily put into their bodies. Decriminalizing drugs will reduce non drug crimes and will free up law enforcement resources to prosecute other more important crimes. Legalizing drugs is a good policy.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Despite all of the money that we spend on keeping drugs illegal this policy is not working. Millions throughout this country still use illegal drugs.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult_lifetime_cannabis_use_by_country"> Over 100 million Americans over the age of 12 have used marijuana at least once during their lives.</a> According a survey by the<a href="http://oas.samhsa.gov/NSDUH/2k10NSDUH/2k10Results.htm"> Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 7.8% of high school seniors surveyed said that they have used cocaine,</a> 16.8% have used amphetamines (speed) , 12% have used hallucinogenic drugs and 47.8 have used marijuana. Is this what we are paying tens of billions of dollars for? Why as a country are we paying billions of dollars to enforce laws that tens of millions people regularly violate? What does trying to enforce an unenforceable law do to the public’s respect of our government and the laws it makes?</p>

<p>I believe that we should adopt the marijuana policy that the Netherlands currently uses. In the Netherlands highly regulated “coffee shops” can sell marijuana to adults. Unlike drug dealers in the U.S “coffee shop” owners in the Netherlands are subject to strict regulation over the quality and safety of their products. A “coffee shop” is prevented from advertising , selling hard drugs or alcohol , selling more than five grams of marijuana during any single transaction or operating within 250 meters of a school.</p>

<p>If our government adopted the same policy as Netherlands of allowing highly regulated stores to legally sell marijuana it would take the crime and violence out of the trade of this drug. Doing this would make it harder for minors to obtain marijuana because the legal stores would have no incentive to risk getting shut down by breaking the law by selling to minors. Legalizing marijuana would also generate tax revenue because unlike the drug dealers the legal sellers of marijuana would pay sales and excise taxes.</p>

<p>I would recommend I policy of drug decriminalization to deal with the “hard” drugs such as cocaine. This policy would be along the lines of the one that currently exists for heroin addicts in Switzerland. Swiss heroin addicts can go to one of 22 government operated clinics to receive a safe,clean and free shot of heroin. While they are at the clinic the addicts will be informed about treatment they can receive to end their addiction. Social workers at the clinics will encourage addicts to seek rehab. The clinics are the only entity that may legally distribute the drugs. Possession of drugs is not prosecuted but drug dealers are. If the U.S adopted this system the illegal drug dealers would soon be out of business as there is no way that they can compete with the clinics that distribute the drugs for free. There will no longer be drug dealers shooting each other in the streets. The drugs distributed by the clinic will be at a constant and safe dosage so there will be a much lower risk of addicts dieing of drug overdose. The drugs will be administered through safe needles, so diseases will no longer be spread through unsafe injections . There will no longer be any more drug dealers to encourage children to take up drugs . The only legal distributor of drugs will be encouraging its clients to kick their drug habit instead of trying to find new clients.</p>

<p>Drug use in the U.S causes many public health issues. These issues can be resolved by drug use decriminalization. In 2001 Portugal decriminalized drug use. <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=portugal-drug-decriminalization">According to an article published in Scientific American the number of new cases of HIV caused by unsafe injections of drugs went from almost 1400 in 2001 to 400 in 2006</a>. Imagine how many lives could be saved if a policy of drug decriminalization was adopted in the U.S and that policy had a similar effect. According to a 2002 fact sheet published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a Federal Government agency unsafe injections of illegal drugs account for over one third of all cases of HIV. An estimated 11,635 people per year in the United States get HIV through unsafe injections of illegal drugs. Other countries that have taken the path of drug decriminalization have had similar reductions in HIV rates. According to the World Health Organization the percentage of users of injected drugs that have HIV declined from 5% in 1991 to 1% in 2006 . It is clear that our current drug policy is a public health disaster and that it will make for a healthier population if we decriminalize drugs</p>

<p>We have already done something similar to our current drug policy. In 1920 the 18th amendment to the constitution was ratified. Section one of it read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After one year from the ratification of this article the manufacture, sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors within, the importation thereof into, or the exportation thereof from the United States and all territory subject to the jurisdiction thereof for beverage purposes is hereby prohibited.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ratification of the 18th amendment brought prohibition into existence. Prohibition turned out in a similar way to our current drug policy. Millions of people throughout the country illegally consumed alcoholic beverages. The prohibition policy increased crime because the mafia became involved in the illegal distribution of alcoholic beverages. Just as thousands of people today are getting sick from unsafe injections of illegal drugs thousands died during prohibition because the illegal producers of alcoholic beverages would mix industrial (denatured) alcohol with their brews to create a stronger beverage. industrial alcohol sometimes contains the toxic methyl alcohol and this ended up killing people. When prohibition was replied legal breweries replaced the illegal ones, safe regulated producers of alcoholic beverages replaced the mafia and a law that millions violated went away .</p>

<p>To those who think that drugs are dangerous because they cause violent crimes I have a response. Much of the crime involved with drugs is because of our current drug policy. Drug dealers shoot each other on the streets over turf to sell their products. Terrorist organizations are funded by the illegal drug trade. A study published by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime found that the Taliban received between 50 to 70 million dollars in revenue through the opium trade. These problems would go away after regulated, legal producers of drugs out competed the drug smugglers.</p>

<p>There is also a moral issue involved here. Why should the government prevent someone from putting a chemical into his or her body if that person willingly does so with full knowledge of the damage possible. This is what the government is doing with it's current drug policies. A person that takes drugs is not harming anyone else. If a addict happens to commit another crime while on drugs then that is a separate issue and that person should be prosecuted for the non-drug crime. However, prosecuting someone because they just put a certain chemical into their bodies takes away part of their right to privacy and their right to control what happens to their own body.</p>

<p>Legalizing drugs will benefit public health, reduce violence and eliminate a law that millions violate each day. We are repeating what happened with Prohibition but just with another substance. Repealing our drug laws will remove a funding source from criminal organizations and will stop drug violence. Replacing our drug laws will reduce infections from unsafe injections and will replace the unregulated drug dealers with a system of regulated manufacturers. It is past time to repeal our drug laws and replace them with something more reasonable.   <!--EndFragment--></p>

      <title>Web/Email Server Configuration With Virtualmin on Ubuntu 12.04</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div>
        
<p>I have recently moved the VPS that this blog is hosted on to a Virtualmin install on Ubuntu 12.04. This tutorial shows how I have configured it. Virtualmin is a free program that can install and manage common server services. Among other things it can manage email (defaulting to the</p>

<p>postfix/dovecot servers), web (defaulting to Apache), and mailing lists (using <a class="zem_slink" title="GNU Mailman" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/" target="_blank" rel="homepage">GNU Mailman</a>). For this tutorial I will assume you have a working Ubuntu 12.04 install. I am using the free/open source GPL licensed version of Virtualmin instead of the proprietary version.</p>
<!--more--><h3>Install Virtualmin and Dependencies</h3>
<p>Virtualmin's developers have produced a script that installs Virtualmin and all of its dependencies. Download the install script with the following command.</p>

<p><em>wget <a href="http://software.virtualmin.com/gpl/scripts/install.sh"></a><a href="http://software.virtualmin.com/gpl/scripts/install.sh">http:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>software.virtualmin.com/<wbr></wbr>gpl/<wbr></wbr>scripts/<wbr></wbr>install.sh</a></em></p>

<p>Run the script to install Virtualmin and its dependencies.</p>

<p><em>/bin/sh install.sh</em></p>

<p>Wait while Virtualmin updates and installs.</p>
<h3>Create a Swap File</h3>
<p>Some of the components of the Virtualmin system can cause peaks of memory usage that can overfill the system ram on some low memory installations.The spam and virus checking programs (Spamassin and ClamAV) used by Virtualmin are particularly likely to cause peaks of RAM usage. For this reason, it is a good idea to create a swap file if you haven't created a swap partition during your install of Ubuntu.Most images distributed by VPS hosts do not include swap space. Run the following commands to create a 1GB swap file.</p>

<p><em>fallocate -l 1000M /swapfile</em></p>

<p><em>chmod 600 /swapfile</em></p>

<p><em>mkswap /swapfile</em></p>

<p>Set the swap file to load on boot by adding a line to /etc/fstab</p>

<p><em>Nano /etc/fstab</em></p>

<p>add</p>

<p><em>/swapfile none swap defaults 0 0</em></p>
<h3>Common PHP Extensions</h3>
<p>Curl and PHP5-gd are common PHP extensions that many PHP applications require. Install them with the following commands.<br /><em>apt-get clean && apt-get update && apt-get install php5-curl</em></p>

<p><em>apt-get install php5-gd</em></p>
<h3>Configure Virtualmin</h3>
<p>Now we have a Virtualmin install with all dependencies. Now it is time to configure Virtualmin.</p>

<p>Go to https://<your ip here>:10000/ and run through the Virtualmin configuration wizard.<br /><br />In my experience, the default PHP upload file size limit is too low for many applications. Change the upload settings with the following procedure. Under Services find "PHP 5 Configuration". Then click "Resource Limits".Edit the "Maximum file upload size" textbox. Save your changes.<br /><br /><a class="zem_slink" title="Greylisting" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greylisting" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">Greylisting</a> is a powerful anti-spam technique that exploits the fact that spammers rarely use standards compliant email servers.The standards for the email protocol allow the receiving server to declare that it is temporarily unavailable instead of outright accepting or rejecting a message. If this happens a standards compliant server will wait and then resend the message.Most spambots will not. Greylisting configures the mail server to declare that it is temporarily unavailable the first time that a server that has never delivered an email to you attempts to send an email. Greylisting may delay some of your email but it is one of the most effective anti-spam methods. To enable it follow the following steps.<br />Under "Email Messages" find "Email Greylisting".Click "Install Greylisting". Under "Email Messages" find "Email Greylisting". Click "Enable Greylisting".<br /><br />DKIM is another anti-spam technique that attempts to filter out spoofed email headers. To enable it follow the following steps. Under "Email Messages" find "DomainKeys Identified Mail". Click "install DKIM".<br /><br /><h3>Add Domain Name</h3><br /><br />You now have a fully configured Virtualmin installation. To add a domain name to it follow the following steps  Click "Create Virtual Server". Fill out the form that appears.<p><a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/adddomainname" class="p-category" rel="tag">#adddomainname</a> <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/configurevirtualmin" class="p-category" rel="tag">#configurevirtualmin</a> <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/old" class="p-category" rel="tag">#old</a> <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/old" class="p-category" rel="tag">#old</a> <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/php" class="p-category" rel="tag">#php</a> <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/uncategorized" class="p-category" rel="tag">#uncategorized</a> <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/vps" class="p-category" rel="tag">#vps</a></p></your></p>

        <p><a href="http://www.mailpile.is/">Mailpile</a> is one of the most interesting free software/open source projects I've seen lately.It is a webmail program that is focused on security and making encryption easy to use while replicating the full feature set of a hosted email system like Gmail. The project is in an early stage of development and is not very usable yet, so it will be interesting to see how close it comes to meeting its goals. Mailpile has raised almost $150,000 in a croudfunding campaign, so it has a good chance of succeeding.</p><!--more--><p>My personal email account is self hosted and there are real benefits to hosting your own email, including resistance to mass surveillance programs and self hosted email is free of the advertising that comes with services like Gmail. However, the current free webmail programs are lackluster. Roundcube and Squirrelmail are the two big programs in this market. <a href="http://squirrelmail.org/">Squirrelmail</a> looks like something from the 90s. <a href="http://roundcube.net/">Roundcube</a> is better but still can't match the feature set of Gmail.</p><p>Mailpile will be able to run as both a web app on a remote server or as an application on the user's computer and if it is able to ship all planned features it will be superior to Roundcube and Squirrelmail. Its planned encryption features are also very interesting. Email is not very secure without encryption. It is <a href="http://www.anonymailer.net/">ea</a><a href="http://www.anonymailer.net/">sy to spoof </a>senders of email and spoofed emails <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1847402/how-to-verify-email-sender-address-is-not-spoofed">are very hard to detect</a> because the email protocol contains no way to authenticate senders.Emails are delivered and stored in plaintext and are therefore vulnerable to interception. PGP email encryption can solve these issues but encryption is difficult with most email clients. If programs like Mailpile are able to get more people to actually use email encryption then it will be a big plus.</p><p><a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/old" class="p-category" rel="tag">#old</a> <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/old" class="p-category" rel="tag">#old</a> <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/pgp" class="p-category" rel="tag">#pgp</a> <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/uncategorized" class="p-category" rel="tag">#uncategorized</a></p></div>]]></description>
