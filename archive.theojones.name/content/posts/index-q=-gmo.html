<p>I've noticed that the hard left has a large amount of opposition to modernism and a good dose of what could be described as reactionaryism (the belief in the return to a past state). Sure, this is commonly (and perhaps almost exclusively) associated with the right-wing, but it's a huge element of some newer left-wing points of view. It's common to view reactionaryism solely in terms of classic social issues, and on these points reactionaryism is an inherently right-wing point of view. But there are other elements of policy and on these it's the left that wants to resist/reverse social progress. Additionally, this is one of the reasons why liberalism is NOT equivalent to progressivism/leftism. It's only an oddity of US politics that has made it seem like this is true. The range of political possibilities in the United States has be limited in such a way as to leave both progressives and liberals in agreement on all major issues of politics. I think this is beginning to change, and there will become an increasingly strong distinction between these two ideologies in the future. I would commit that within the next 10 or so years this will become a very noticeable distinction -- similar to the one that splits conservatives and libertarians. The dispute is fundamentally over the three pillars of enlightenment liberalism 1) science as the arbitrator of knowledge,2) democracy and due process as the arbitrator of political outcomes, and 3) individual liberty. Here are a few of the reactionary tendencies in the left wing viewpoint</p>
<ol><li>A dislike of science. This can be seen in issues like the debate over GMO's and similar conflicts. This can also be seen in the broader world of ideology. The world of left-leaning academic theory is almost overwhelmingly skeptical of the view that human society can be studied scientifically using the (largely quantative) methods commonly associated with the natural sciences. At the very least, this involves an emphasis on "other ways of knowing", and on the self-reported and analyzed "lived experiences" of people. This comes under such names as "structuralism" in the literature. The most extreme form of this comes under such names as post-structuralism and postmodernism and outright disputes the primacy of science even in the realm of the natural sciences, like physics and biology. This is of, course a highly problematic position, but is not at all rare in the world of diversity studies, and other left-leaning elements of the humanities.</li>
<li><p>Persistent clashes with freedom of speech. A lot of members of the modern left don't recognize the liberal distinction between speech and action. They have resurrected the ancient view that offensive speech or an attack on personal honor is an equivalent to physical violence. They act as if the advocacy of a course of action, or the belief that a course of action is within one's rights, or the attempt to participate in the political process, is equivalent to actually doing the action in question. This treatment of disagreeable speech as an equivalent of a physical attack also materializes into things like "trigger warnings" and the "safe place" movement. This bodes poorly for the underlying conception of democracy. Democracy feeds on public contestability and public debate of possible options. The vast majority of policy proposals will prove to be wrongheaded, and will be rightly rejected. But the process of free discourse and debate is absolutely essential to this process. Enlightenment civic republicanism came into existence in about the same time as science, because the two are innately linked. Both rely on decentralized finding of knowledge. In the case of science, this is for finding facts, in the case of democracy this is for determining how to run society. An attack on free speech is a full scale attack on both.</p></li>
<li><p>A neo-luddite view of technology and industrialization. Widespread industrialization and deployment of technology has vastly improved the standard of living of the typical person. However, many elements of the hard left want to return to a "small is beautiful" way of running the economy. An emphasis is put on small businesses and cooperatives. Some want a small scale and decentralized economy that looks a lot like the pre-industrial world. Its states' rights for progressives. And equally absurd. Despite its flaws, major firms can put in place a large degree of economic planning and stability that smaller firms cannot. They can leverage economies of scale, and they have vast efficiency improvements over smaller firms when they produce a uniform product Small is not efficient.</p></li>

<p>In issues like the "debate" over GMOs I've seen a pattern where extreme charity is given to the arguments of the antiscience side. Let's take a person who thinks GMOs cause health issues clearly, by the plain language of how he phrases things indicates that he thinks that method of genetic modification introduces the health risk. It's a blatantly absurd position. Genetic modification is a method to synthesize compounds. A chemical compound is the same thing the matter how it was synthesized. BT toxin from a GMO corn plant is unequivocally the exact same compound is BT toxin collected from <em>B. thuringiensis </em>bacteria. This is completely without doubt. For a chemical that have "memory" of how it was synthesized or its past would contradict a vast swath of physics, chemistry, and biology. However, it is quite common this type of debate for the other side to rephrase his argument away from the plain language of it but towards a more plausible but different argument. Those scientifically literate people will tend to interpret the statement not as what its plain language says of compounds having "memory" but will instead interpret it as some kind of a claim at BT toxin itself is dangerous. (Which is itself an extremely doubtful claim that contradict quite a bit of scientific research, and known mechanism of how the toxin works against insects) Of course, this cannot be what most of the GMO health risk types mean, as they have no objection to the use of <em>B. thuringiensis </em>bacteria and the toxin it produces in organic agriculture. They must mean the prime face absurd claim that chemical compounds remember their past. Why should anyone do this charitable interpretation of what they are saying? Me? I am now at the point where I assume people exposing crank viewpoints mean what they say and say what they mean. If you say something that's clearly in contradiction with a large swath of science, I'm going to assume very vastly ignorant,or  are engaging in outright science denialism. I think, reason why a lot of people reinterpret what crackpots have to say, is because the claims of antiscience types are so absurd they immediately assume no one could seriously mean them. But, there are vastly ignorant or deluded people out there. There are people who put their preconceptions before any reasonable logic. There are people who don't understand the basics of chemistry and physics. There are Luddite types that have an extreme knee-jerk opposition to technology. It's time to take them seriously.</p>

<p>The idea that antiscience tendencies are just a right-wing thing is often presented. In this post I will argue that science denialism is as big a problem for the left as for the right. The right wing examples of this are clear and blatant; creationism, climate change skepticism, issues excepting basic public health knowledge, and so on. However, the left has its own skeletons in the closet. Antiscience is something that comes out of ideology. Strict ideology and partisanship is the mind killer. In some ideological fact become such a part of someone's worldview that is beyond reproach them, denial of facts is a simple consequence. Many people want a world where the facts neatly aligned with their political beliefs, as these beliefs that come stronger, more partisan, more ideological the contradictions between the belief and the real world will become more acute. A vast portion of the antiscience tendencies and current politics come from this tendency. It is easy to try to adjust the facts to your belief, instead of the other way around. The only way to prevent people from denying basic facts of science is to train people to be rational and to put behind partisanship and ideology when the facts clearly contradict deeply held beliefs. It's not primarily a problem of lack of education, <a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/2015/01/education-plus-ideology-exaggerates-rejection-of-reality/">studies have looked at this and found that generally education is little to do with science denying tendencies and can in fact make them worse in some cases</a>, it's a problem of politics and people. The fact that people often deny reality conflicts with their subjective viewpoint creates something I've heard called "crank magnetism". Crackpot ideas are rarely alone, and someone who believes one crank theory likely believes another. Really, I think politics has a lot to with this. A lot of people don't want to accept facts that are inconvenient to their political ideology. And some people are more likely to reject facts to preserve their ideology than others. Just in my contacts, I've noticed a lot of overlap between global warming denialism ,creationism, and general conspiracy theories (new world order, Illuminati , birtherism, Agenda 21, moon landing hoax, etc...) . These people tend to be politically right wing. I've also noticed a left-wing crank cluster. Anti-GMO crap, alternative medicine, homeopathy, vitalism, problems accepting some basic principles of economics (this last one could probably be put as both an issue of the left-wing and right-wing, but it's probably more problematic in the left, I'll discuss more about how people's understandings of economics can elucidate a lot about how people come to deny facts in a later post) and a general persistence of Freudian type psychoanalytic ideas in much of left-wing  (particularly feminist academic theory). Additionally<a href="http://old.richarddawkins.net/articles/824-postmodernism-disrobed">, persistence of so-called "postmodernist" ideas in left-wing theory also tell us a lot about antiscience in the left</a>. Anti-vaccine nonsense seems to be the one overlap between the two. I will go into a bit more about that left-wing crackpot cluster.</p>
<ol><li>As I have discussed earlier in this blog, opposition to genetically modified foods from the left is absurd and reflective of many the antiscience trends in the left. Pretty much every major public health organization in the world is concluded there is little risk to the health of the public from GM foods. In fact, there is quite a bit of potential from this technology. And use of genetic modification by many accounts has increased agricultural yields. While there are some legitimate issues of the current deployment of technologies, there are few issues that are unique to this industry (anti-GMO activists will often point out the patent trolling by many companies in this industry, but patent trolling is becoming pretty common across the tech world). And there is pretty much no scientific basis to GMO bans or GMO labeling mandates, in fact many GMO labeling proposals produce substantial constitutional issues.
</li><li>Certain types of hipster left-wingers seem strongly attracted to alternative medicine. But there is a reason why most alternative medicine is "alternative". It doesn't work. Medicine that works is just called "medicine". Homeopathy is a particular type of alternative medicine that has a very large following. The scientific evidence on the subject unequivocally indicates that homeopathy treatments simply put, do not work at all, in fact the core theories of homeopathy violate fundamental principles of physics, chemistry, and biology. Homeopathy treatments are usually diluted to such an extent and there is little to no active ingredient actually present in the tincture. The problem with alternative medicine is that it's use tends to displace real medicine. People waste money on quacks instead of seeing real doctors for their issues. Money and lives are put at risk. And due to opposition from the left that attempts to regulate alternative medicine, little is done to stop this damage.
</li><li>Embedded in both the opposition to GMOs and the belief in alternative medicine is a pseudo-vitalism. A lot of people believe in some kind of inherent life force found in living things that is not found elsewhere. There is, of course, absolutely no scientific evidence for such a thing.
</li><li>I'll discuss some of the issues of economics in a later post.
</li><li>The pseudoscientific tendencies much of critical theory and the like is clear. A lot of this very embeds a pseudoscientific quasi-Freudian understanding of human psychology, particularly the idea of the deep subconscious which is reflected by people's thoughts and the media in the art that results from these thoughts. Since this is a detailed enough subject to be worth quite a bit more time than I could give it in this single post, I will probably write an additional post on the subject.

<p>Vermont passed a law requiring the labeling of GMO products a few months ago. The law won't take effect until 2016, but there is already litigation about the constitutionality of the legislation. In this post I will argue that the labeling law most likely violates the protections of the First Amendment. Due to the <a href="http://hstlj.org/articles/a-brief-history-of-the-commercial-speech-doctrine-with-some-implications-for-tobacco-regulation/">commercial speech doctrine</a> courts have ruled that advertising (including product labeling) is protected by the Constitution, although to a lesser extent than other forms of speech. The courts have not precisely delineated a boundary for when law makers can regulate commercial speech, but have generally found that</p>

<p>there must be a provable harm (or at least possible harm) to the consumer. Courts have given little weight to subjective consumer preferences, leaving the fulfillment of those to the market. There are some trends in the major Supreme Court cases on the subject such as <em>Virginia State Board of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council</em>, and <em>Central Hudson Gas v. Public Service Commission of New York</em></p>
<ol><li>The general standard for commercial speech cases is intermediate scrutiny. This also is the standard that applies to time place and manner speech restrictions (like city noise laws), sex/gender discrimination( among other protected classes).To pass this standard a law must further important government interest in a way that is substantially related to that interest</li>
    <li>Lawmakers have broad power to ban false advertising and advertising for illegal products.</li>
    <li>Advertising over electronic media receives lower protection than adverting in traditional publications.</li>
    <li>Prior restraint is permissible in the realm of commercial speech</li>
    <li>There is a wide scope for disclosure regulations, but there still needs to be a substantial government interest involved. Justifications based on consumer choice in the absence of tangible harm are usually not sufficient.</li>
</ol>
<p>The most similar case to the GMO one is <em>International Dairy Foods Association v. Amestoy</em> which came before the Second Circuit. This case involved a Vermont labeling law mandating that dairy products produced by cows treated with the rBST hormone be labeled. The government made no claims of a safety risk before the court, and the plaintiffs in that case entered evidence indicating that there was no safety risk. The trial court opinion noted that the government “does not claim that health or safety concerns prompted the passage of the Vermont Labeling Law,” and that there defense is based around "strong consumer interest and the public's ‘right to know’". The Second Circuit found that this interest in consumer choice is not a substantial interest. There may have been animal welfare justifications for the law made in the public discourse, but neither side made such arguments before the court, so that issue was never considered. However, a consumer survey was entered as evidence that indicated that such issues were a reason why consumers may have wanted to avoid rBST products, but none of these responces ammounted to a full argument on this basis (other than noting that the cows were “Producing enough milk already.”) The court found that the most common consumer reasons included</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>(1) They consider the use of a genetically-engineered hormone in the production unnatural;  (2) they believe that use of the hormone will result in increased milk production and lower milk prices, thereby hurting small dairy farmers;  (3) they believe that the use of rBST is harmful to cows and potentially harmful to humans;  and, (4) they feel that there is a lack of knowledge regarding the long-term effects of rBST.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The situation with GMO labeling is even less favorable. There are no reasonable safety arguments that could be used against GMO products. As the GMO products targeted are plants there are not any animal welfare arguments either. This leaves the consumer choice argument, which courts have already rejected as problematic. Allowing abstract preferences that have no basis in fact into the law produces severely paradoxical results when used to justify limits on fundamental rights. Imagine if such preferences were allowed into the other areas of law where the intermediate scrutiny standard was used. The results would be clearly unacceptable. Satisfying subjective consumer preferences in an efficient way are what markets are good at. If there is a consumer demand for notice about GMO products, then a voluntary (and perhaps privately owned) certification system should serve the purpose (with the producers paying the full cost of maintaining the system through fees).</p>

<p><i><a href="https://theojones.name/blog-post-series-on-the-history-of-sustainable-energy-and-climate-change-politics/">This is part of a blog post series on climate change.</a></i>In this post I am using a new way of doing citations that I will use in some of my longer posts.

<p>The opposition to the development of nuclear energy was probably one of the worst mistakes the movement has ever made. A rapid conversion to nuclear energy in the 1970s – like the one France did – would have vastly reduced greenhouse gas emissions. France’s per capita greenhouse gas emissions (mostly due to cars, and heating fuel) is substantially less than the EU average, and a little over a third of the GHG emissions of the United States.

<p>sources have higher environmental impact than nuclear due to the large levels of natural resources needed to make wind and solar collectors, and due to the land-use of renewable sources. Nuclear is at cost parity with fossil fuels (even unsubsidized), while renewable still cost substantially more than traditional sources. The environmental opposition to nuclear energy has largely come out of two places. 1) the opposition to nuclear weapons (note the ”peace” in ”Greenpeace”), 2) a general technophobia. I will discuss both of these trends in this section. The relation between opposition to nuclear weapons, and the opposition to nuclear energy certainly exists for Greenpeace. The group was founded in part to oppose a nuclear weapons test on the Alaskan island of Amchitka. There were some concerns that this test could trigger geologic events like earthquakes or tsunamis. Greenpeace eventually formed out a group of (mostly Quaker) protesters opposing this event. Some of their tactics were opposed by established environmental groups – like the Sierra Club. Greenpeace’s website declares that <i>”motivated by their vision of a green and peaceful world, a small team of activists set sail from Vancouver, Canada in an old fishing boat. These activists, the founders of Greenpeace, believed a few individuals could make a difference... Amchitka was the last refuge for 3,000 endangered sea otters, and home to bald eagles, peregrine falcons, and other wildlife.”</i>[2].After this fissure with the environmental movement they eventually formed their own organization. Even today Greenpeace’s states that their mission includes the following goal ”<i>Working for disarmament and peace by reducing dependence on finite resources and calling for the elimination of all nuclear weapons.</i>” [3]. The group has even recently been involved in anti-war protests. In June of 2014 the group conducted a protest against NSA surveillance, and the construction of a new NSA data center [4]. Greenpeace is opposed to civilian nuclear energy and considers nuclear energy as a potential source of nuclear proflarition. They argue that the ability of nuclear energy to mitigate climate change is minor. They argue that the energy source has a high risk of accident, argue that nuclear energy has strong environmental impacts, and that nuclear energy is plagued by slow construction times, and dramatic cost overruns. They also argue that it competes with renewable energy for funding. I will discuss the ability for nuclear energy to mitigate climate change elsewhere, – in short it is very large. In fact it is possible to create a climate mitigation strategy that largely reilyes on nuclear energy. The construction times of nuclear energy are not a product of the technology but instead a product of the regulatory environment and finance. Nuclear energy construction times in France during the 1970s were around two years – similar to the construction times of renewable energy projects. Construction times in the U.S in the 50s and 60s were also around two years. There have been no major accidents at any of these projects. A major difference between these projects and modern ones is that these rapidly completed projects were generally publicly owned. Public or quasi-public ownership may be the preferable way to manage energy projects. With nuclear energy there is a general conflict of interest with the profit role and the public safety role. This produces a risk of an extrenality cost, and this is only mitigated by a expensive regulatory process. Public ownership avoids this conflict of interest. I would also argue that similar conflicts of interest have the potential to occur with renewable energy. There will be a large number of subsidies and government funding available to privately owned renewable energy firms, and it will be a tough regulatory challenge to provide that these funds are well-used. Later, I will discuss a proposal for quasi-public ownership of energy infrastructure that still allows for reasonable market pressure. In reality the opposition to nuclear energy has been one of the largest delays in the mitigation of climate change.</p>

<p>To the credit of Greenpeace, they have been one of the most vocal proponents of action on climate change. They call climate change ”the number one threat facing our planet”. They argue for a rapid mitigation of the threat. In their plan developed nation emissions would be reduced by 40 percent by 2020 and global emissions would be reduced to near zero. The group has also been a major contributor to activism on other environmental issues.<br />There is another source of opposition to nuclear energy. A general opposi tion of projects perceived to be non-”natural” over projects perceived to have a ”natural” basis. Even when the more ”natural” project is worse for the environment. This comes with a general embrace of pseudoscience within the more hardline elements environmental community, and a general opposition to technology. A lot of this conception of ”naturalness” comes from a vague perception of semi-vitalism – a belief that living/”natural” things have some property beyond their mere chemical composition. There is no scientific evidence for such a claim, but it is common/implied in arguments for ”alternative” (read: useless) medicine, organic foods (the certification for these foods is a mix of things that do some good, and things that are net harmful), opposition to the use of pesticides (which often net help the environment by reducing land use) and other issues. This perception, I believe, is at the core of a lot of the opposition to technological innovations among environmental groups. This is the most clear in the arguments against GMO crops.<br />The claims made by the campaigners against genetically modified foods are simply absurd. This ideology’s claims about the health effects of GMOs are as discredited in the scientific community as creationism or global warming denialism and all major scientific associations of repute that have looked into the issue disavow it. Their position that a compound can suddenly become toxic when synthesized due to a genetic modification of a plant, but is not toxic when synthesized by a natural process violates the laws of physics, chemistry and biology (It is worth noting that the BT toxin – a common product of genetic modification – is also a commonly used pest control in organic food, due to the fact that it is produced in the bacterium <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i>) Their understanding of the economics of these products is not much better. These compounds have passed the approval of the FDA and the EPA. our food is not being poisoned by Monsanto (or the Illuminati, or whoever else the people at Natural News are blaming today). While Monsanto and its ilk have business practices that are very good, the same can be said of major players in almost every industry in the world. In my opinion this ”movement” is just dressed-up ludditeism – both in the modern sense of general technophobia, and in the sense of the historical Luddite movement’s belief that the abuses of sweatshops were an inevitable outcome of the automation of textile production.<br />Technophobia is a core undercurrent of the anti-GMO ideology. When you read their discussions about ”frankenfoods” (of course ignoring the fact that almost all domesticated plants and animals differ greatly from their wild relatives) they are employing the idea that new technology is inherently bad and dangerous, while the ”natural” is inherently good and safe. Nothing of the kind is true. Technology has a great ability to improve our standard of living and there are many things that ”natural” Of course there are also harmful synthetic products.I put the word ”natural” in quotes because man-made things and ”natural” products are created by the same laws of physics. In reality,<br />everything in this universe is natural. To the anti-GMO activist, ”natural” just means created with recently invented technology and this technology is scary.<br />Like the historical Luddites who blamed technology for the ills of the textile industry, when these issues were really created by unethical business practices,anti-GMO activists claim that the bad behavior of business is the unavoidable result of technology. These activists (rightly) criticize the patent litigation of Monsanto. However, instead of seeing this as another symptom of a broken patent system, they inexplicably blame the technology. These activists (rightly) see a greedy monopolist in Monsanto but they blame the technology instead of calling for anti-trust reform. This attitude will only serve to hold back the progress made possible by technology, without dealing with the systemic issues that allowed these unethicalbusiness practices. Rest assured that even without GMO foods, these economic issues will continue to wreak havoc in other sectors of the economy.A common third way approach to the GMO issue is labling. Now I will discuss why GMO labeling is a terrible idea. There is no scientific basis to fear GMO products.The claimed consumer choice benefits of mandatory labeling can be fulfilled by private certifications and currently existing, government ran certification programs.Due to the dynamics of food markets, mandatory GMO labeling amounts to a defacto GMO ban. This will increase food prices and possibly add to the environmental damage cause by agriculture.The World Health Organization notes ”GM foods currently available on the international market have passed risk assessments and are not likely to present risks for human health”.The American Association for the Advancement of Science concluded that ”Several current efforts to require labeling of GM foods are not being driven by any credible scientific evidence that these foods are dangerous” and that ”GM crops are the most extensively tested crops ever”.Their report also noted that labeling could mislead and falsely alarm consumers.<br />All of the claimed consumer choice benefits of GMO labeling can be done by voluntary certification. All products currently sold as organic in the U.S lack GMO products. Private certifications are also very good at assuring that products are prepared in accordance to standards that are sufficient for their consumers. Note that there are many private companies which certify kosher products. Economies of scale in food production make it inefficient and cost prohibitive for companies to create separate product lines with GMO and non-GMO foods. Therefore, just one of these options will be taken.If the labeling causes a substantial minority of the population to avoid GMO foods then these foods will be forced off the market for everyone. This has already happened in Europe, where GMO labeling is mandatory. In fact, the push for labeling by the anti-GMO movement is just a pretext to regulate these products out of existence.This will harm consumers and the environment because GMO products require less land usage than their competitors. The price of this extra land will be passed on to consumers, along with the price of increased crop loss. This increased land usage will also have substantial environmental impacts. However, there will be no clear economic benefits to this defacto ban on GMO foods.</p>

                <span class="vague">3 min read </span>
            </p>
            
<p>In a previous post I discussed the <a title="The Ludditeism of the Anti-GMO Ideologues" href="https://theojones.name/index.php/ludditeism-anti-gmo-ideologues/">bankruptcy of anti-GMO arguments</a>. Now I will discuss why GMO labeling is a terrible idea.</p>
<ol><li>As I showed in my last post there is no scientific basis to fear GMO products.</li>
    <li>The claimed consumer choice benefits of mandatory labeling can be fulfilled by private certifications and currently existing, government ran certification programs</li>
    <li>Due to the dynamics of food markets, mandatory GMO labeling amounts to a defacto GMO ban. This will increase food prices and possibly add to the environmental damage cause by agriculture.</li>
</ol>
<p><!--more-->If you haven't read my previous post on GMOs, let me recap what I said about the health effects of these products.</p>

<p>The claims made by the campaigners against genetically modified foods are simply absurd. This ideology’s claims about the health effects of GMOs are as discredited in the scientific community as creationism or global warming denialism and all major scientific associations of reputethat have looked into the issue disavow it.  Their position that a compound can suddenly become toxic when synthesized due to a genetic modification of a plant, but is not toxic when synthesized by a natural process violates the laws of physics, chemistry and biology. Their understanding of the economics of these products is not much better. These compounds have passed the approval of the FDA and the EPA. Your food is not being poisoned by <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">the Illuminati</span> Monsanto. The <a href="http://www.who.int/foodsafety/publications/biotech/20questions/en/">World Health Organization notes</a>, "GM foods currently available on the international market have passed risk assessments and are not likely to present risks for human health". <a href="http://www.aaas.org/news/aaas-board-directors-legally-mandating-gm-food-labels-could-%E2%80%9Cmislead-and-falsely-alarm">The American Association for the Advancement of Science concluded that</a> "Several current efforts to require labeling of GM foods are not being driven by any credible scientific evidence that these foods are dangerous" and that "GM crops are the most extensively tested crops ever". Their report also noted that labeling could “mislead and falsely alarm consumers”.</p>

<p>All of the claimed consumer choice benefits of GMO labeling can be done by voluntary certification. All products currently sold as organic in the U.S lack GMO products. Private certifications are also very good at assuring that products are prepared in accordance to standards that are sufficient for their consumers. Note that there are many private companies which certify kosher products.</p>

<p>Economies of scale in food production make it inefficient and cost prohibitive for companies to create separate product lines with GMO and non-GMO foods. Therefore, just one of these options will be taken.If the labeling causes a substantial minority of the population to avoid GMO foods then these foods will be forced off the market for everyone. This has already happened in Europe, where GMO labeling is mandatory. In fact, the push for labeling by the anti-GMO movement is just a pretext to regulate these products out of existence.This will harm consumers and the environment because GMO products require less land usage than their competitors. The price of this extra land will be passed on to consumers, along with the price of increased crop loss. This increased land usage will also have substantial environmental impacts. However, there will be no clear economic benefits to this defacto ban on GMO foods.</p>

<p>The claims made by the campaigners against genetically modified foods are simply absurd. This ideology's claims about the health effects of GMOs are as discredited in the scientific community as creationism or global warming denialism and all major scientific associations of repute</p>

<p>[caption id="attachment_762" align="alignright" width="318"] "The Leader of the Luddites" ,Via the British Museum[/caption]</p>

<p>that have looked into the issue disavow it.  Their position that a compound can suddenly become toxic when synthesized due to a genetic modification of a plant, but is not toxic when synthesized by a natural process violates the laws of physics, chemistry and biology [1. It is worth noting that the BT toxin -- a common product of genetic modification -- is also a commonly used pest control in organic food, due to the fact that it is produced in the bacterium <em>Bacillus thuringiensis</em>]. Their understanding of the economics of these products is not much better. These compounds have passed the approval of the FDA and the EPA. Your food is not being poisoned by <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">the Illuminati</span> Monsanto. While Monsanto and its ilk are filled with greedy SOBs, the same can be said of major players of almost every industry in the world. In my opinion this "movement" is just dressed-up ludditeism -- both in the modern sense of general technophobia, and in the sense of the historical Luddite movement's belief that the abuses of sweatshops were an inevitable outcome of the automation of textile production.</p>

<p>Technophobia is a core undercurrent of the anti-GMO ideology. When you read their discussions about "frankenfoods" (of course ignoring the fact that almost all domesticated plants and animals differ greatly from their wild relatives) they are employing the idea that new technology is inherently bad and dangerous, while the "natural" is inherently good and safe. Nothing of the kind is true. Technology has a great ability to improve our standard of living and there are many things that "natural"   Of course there are also harmful synthetic products.I put the word "natural" in quotes because man-made things and "natural" products are created by the same laws of physics. In reality, everything in this universe is natural. To the anti-GMO activist, "natural" just means created with recently invented technology and this technology is scary.</p>

<p>Like the historical Luddites who blamed technology for the ills of the textile industry, when these issues were really created by unethical business practices, anti-GMO activists claim that the bad behavior of business is the unavoidable result of technology. These activists (rightly) criticize the patent litigation of Monsanto. However, instead of seeing this as another symptom of a broken patent system, they inexplicably blame the technology. These activists (rightly) see a greedy monopolist  in Monsanto but they blame the technology instead of calling for anti-trust reform. This attitude will only serve to hold back the progress made possible by technology, without dealing with the systemic issues that allowed these unethical business practices. Rest assured that even without GMO foods, these economic issues will continue to wreak havoc in other sectors of the economy.</p>
