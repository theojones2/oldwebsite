<p>This blog post was inspired by two articles that I've read. One discusses <a href="http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/At_Hong_Kong_High_Tech_Cafe_Everything_Is_Served_With_Microchips_999.html">a restaurant in Hong Kong</a> which is almost fully automated. The orders are taken and the food is delivered by robots. [caption id="attachment_1447" align="alignright" width="211"]<a href="http://www.theojones.name/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/3441244946_f5fbfe7fc7_o.jpg"><img src="http://www.theojones.name/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/3441244946_f5fbfe7fc7_o-211x300.jpg" alt="Image via Flickr user  Christelle &lt;a href=" https:>https:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>flic.kr/<wbr></wbr>p/<wbr></wbr>6f6heq</a>" width="211" height="300" class="size-medium wp-image-1447" /&gt; Image via Flickr user  Christelle<br /><a href="https://flic.kr/p/6f6heq%5B/caption%5DThe">https:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>flic.kr/<wbr></wbr>p/<wbr></wbr>6f6heq[/<wbr></wbr>caption]The</a> only human workers are the chefs, and those conducting maintenance on the robots. The second is <a href="http://pando.com/2014/07/17/new-san-francisco-billboard-warns-workers-theyll-be-replaced-by-ipads-if-they-demand-a-fair-wage/">about a advertising campaign</a> against the San Francisco minimum wage increase with a billboard that reads "San Francisco, meet your minimum wage replacement." The ad then shows an iPad with the text "May I take your Order". The thing is, minimum wage or not, a computer will be taking your order eventually. The tech used in the Hong Kong establishment is not mature by any means -- the maintenance of the robots takes more time and money than human workers -- and that restaurant relies on the novelty of being futuristic. However, one thing that computer technology is good at is becoming better and cheaper over time. It is close to inevitable that there will be robots of the future that are cheaper and better than the humans that they will replace. Robot waitstaff will not make (as many) errors as humans, and will be able to have a much  wider knowledge of the tastes of patrons than a human. Pretty much all non-creative work will be at some danger of automation in the near future.</p>
