            </p>
            
<p>The Indiana legislature is considering a law that is very similar to the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act.  The bill provides that religious belief exempts one from regulations, even neutral ones, unless the government produces a compelling need. Neither the Indiana bill nor its federal twin are particular to any type of regulation and include everything from anti-discrimination laws to drug possession laws (the original inspiration for the federal RFRA). I don't think either law is a good idea. The idea of religious exemptions from neutral laws is almost always a bad idea. This is a good issue to actually read the bill on, and to read (or at least Wikipedia) some of the relevant court opinions. <a href="https://iga.in.gov/static-documents/9/2/b/a/92bab197/SB0101.05.ENRS.pdf">The bill is only four generously spaced pages long</a>.  The media coverage on this subject is pretty error ridden and contains a lot of misconceptions about what the bill actually says. The religious should not be exempted from neutral laws on the basis of religious belief and I oppose it. But, a lot of people fundamentally misunderstand what the bill actually says. A number of media outlets have claimed that it's an anti-gay bill (even though it does not directly touch on that subject, <a href="http://www.indystar.com/story/opinion/readers/2015/03/07/indiana-needs-religious-freedom-legislation/24477303/">and it likely will not affect anti-discrimination law in any meaningful way</a>). The point of this post will be to clarify a bit of the legal background, and to summarize the bill.  The Supreme Court has made it pretty clear that that the First Amendment does not allow people to ignore neutral laws on the basis of religious belief (with a handful of exceptions. See, for example, <em>Employment Division v. Smith</em>. The goal of RFRAs is to override that ruling (the federal RFRA was actually spawned by that ruling) and make actions conducted as a product of religious belief protected. Now, I strongly believe that SCOTUS got it right in Smith, and that RFRAs are fundamentally a bad idea, but the final decision belongs with the legislative branch.  Lets look at what the 11-section Indiana bill (which is likely to pass) actually says as I go through a brief summary</p>
<ul><li>Section 1: Says that the bill applies to all government laws and regulations, even ones made prior to the enactment of it. 
</li><li>Section 2: Only regulations particularly exempted by law are exempt.
</li><li>Section 3: Definitions. Says that regulators are not allowed to use unconstutional provisions to work around the bill with particular mention of the establishment clause of the first amendment. 
</li><li>Section 4: More definitions. Pretty obvious and straightforward stuff. 
</li><li>Section 5. Defines "exercise of religion" as "any exercise of religion, whether or not compelled by, or central to, a system of religious belief". 
</li><li>Section 6: Defines "government entity". 
</li><li>Section 7: Defines "Person", includes corporations, but so does the federal RFRA.
</li><li>Section 8: States that a governmental entity may not substantially burden a person's exercise of religion unless it meets strict scrutiny
</li><li>Section 9: People can sue over violations of the law. 
</li><li>Section 10: Government agencies can be ordered to pay damages to those affected. 
</li><li>Section 11: The bill does not limit the actions of private actors, only government actions, laws and regulations.
</li></ul>
<p>Section 8 is the core of the bill and most of the definition sections are mostly boilerplate. This legislation is likely not just a useless repetition of current law. It goes far beyond what the Constitution mandates and even with the federal RFRA, a state RFRA has some effect. In <em>City of Boerne v. Flores</em> the Supreme Court struck down the part of the federal RFRA that applies to the states. But panicking over a state RFRA is a bit too much because we have a decade's worth of litigation over its federal version and good caselaw on what it means.</p>

<p>A huge issue with a lot of discussions of how to handle trolling on the internet is that it is often not recognized that trolling refers to three distinct types of behavior. For one of these the usual no troll feeding logic applies, but for the others that is a much more dubious rule to follow. Here is my taxonomy of trolling</p>
<ul><li>The classic troll: This is the core thing that people think of when they think of trolling. This type of troll posts things on message boards to with the intent of getting the most lulzy response from that community. This is the type of troll that rants about how bad Micro$haft winblows is. But other than being mildly annoying and disruptive, the attention getting behavior of this troll type is pretty harmless. This is also the type of troll that the no feeding rule works the best for.  The other type of trolls are more toxic extensions of this variant. 
</li><li>The "flacker" – this type of troll is an ideologue that exhibits a lot of the same effect as the classic troll, but this effect and behavior is the result of extremism, not lulz seeking. Limited feeding/interaction with trolls of this kind is not useless, but you are usually dealing with a personality that is immune to logic.
</li><li>The grifer. This is the type of troll that does extremely destructive behavior like harassment, doxing, SWATing, script kiddy hacking, defacement of websites, mailbombing, and the like. This type of troll deserves a decisive response, and should not just be ignored.  This is the type that inhabits such places as 8chan /Baphomet/.</li></ul><p><a href="../../tag/uncategorized.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#uncategorized</a></p></div>                    </div>

<p>The conservative website Red State recently published an editorial about the Department of Justice report on the Ferguson Police Department. Although Red State is the type of place I generally consider unreliable, (however, liberal sites like Daily Kos have also been pretty good BS sources on this topic) the article sums up the topic pretty well, and explains why some of FPD's actions are of concern. <br /><a href="http://www.redstate.com/2015/03/15/many-conservatives-blowing-it-ferguson-doj-report/"></a><a href="http://www.redstate.com/2015/03/15/many-conservatives-blowing-it-ferguson-doj-report/">http:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>www.redstate.com/<wbr></wbr>2015/<wbr></wbr>03/<wbr></wbr>15/<wbr></wbr>many-conservatives-blowing-it-ferguson-doj-report/<wbr></wbr></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s unfortunate, the way news is consumed and interpreted in the age of twitter. Everyone feels tremendous pressure to form an opinion quickly and state it loudly and with certainty. Once this has been done, people are highly resistant to changing their minds and they become impervious to new evidence, often dismissing out of hand outright facts just because they are reported by a given source (e.g., “the media is untrustworthy” or “you can’t trust the Holder Department of Justice.”) Perhaps nowhere has this phenomenon been more obvious (or regrettable) than in Ferguson, Missouri, in the wake of the shooting death of Michael Brown. Interpreting the news out of Ferguson has become a part of ideological tribalism in which, if you are a conservative you stand for the Ferguson PD and if you are a liberal you stand against them. Thus, liberals have become highly resistant to assimilating information that strongly suggests that “hands up, don’t shoot” never happened. Conservatives, on the other hand, have become highly resistant to assimilating information that strongly suggests that the Ferguson PD – as with many other municipal police departments in the country – truly is out of control, in that it recklessly violates the constitutional rights of the citizens of Ferguson and does so in a manner that has a clearly disproportionate impact on minorities.</p>

<p>I've been having an issue with a<a href="../../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Capture.png.html"><amp-img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1818" src="http://www.theojones.name/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Capture-300x261.png" alt="Capture" width="300" height="261"></a> temporary freeze of my Windows 8.1 computer followed shortly by very high disk read-write activity. I took a while, but I pinned the issue down to swapping. In short, the memory management on Windows is terrible compared to that of Linux. And a Windows computer (or at least mine) will start swapping if you look at it the wrong way -- even if there are gigabytes of RAM left. The only way to fix this is to eliminate the swap file. This should be only done if there is a lot of ram on the system in question -- because if RAM runs out while swapping is off programs are going to crash.</p>

<p>To turn off swapping do the following: <br /> 1. Go to the Control Panel.  Find All control panel items &gt; System<br /> 2. Click on "Advanced system settings"<br /> 3. Under performance, click on "settings"<br /> 4. Go to the "Advanced" tab<br /> 5. Under Virtual memory, click on Change<br /> 6. Disable the "Automatically manage paging file size for all drives" check box<br /> 7. Zero it out.</p>

<p>The startup called <a href="https://thegrid.io/">thegrid</a> is releasing a product that is effectively a content management system, roughly similar in functionality to WordPress and such. This startup seems to be promising is software that can handle website design task in a more intelligent way than a traditional template-filling content management system. The company is accepting preorders and has done a pretty intensive advertising campaign on Facebook and other social media and has gotten quite a bit of media attention. They haven't released a beta of it yet, but when they do have something released I'll write a follow-up article saying what I think of it. But just seeing their advertising material on the articles have been written about it I have a few thoughts so far.</p>
<ul><li> This is the type of software that is either going to be absolutely terrible or is going to be very good. I have signed up for the pre order but I wouldn't recommend paying for the preorder unless you are willing to be disappointed. However, it might be worth it you're willing to take a risk, as they do give some discounts for later usage to those who preorder. Having not seen an actual release of this software, I can't recommend it yet. 
</li><li> I seriously doubt that it's going to replace WordPress on this website (unless it has some very impressive features, just on account of the level of commitment I've put into the Wordpress platform already. But it may replace Wordpress as my general go to recommendation for novice computer users wanting to create a website and if it's functional it might be the type of software I use for some new websites.
</li><li>There is a serious market for content management systems are easy to use for not computer types. I think this is the main reason why content silos like Twitter or Facebook or such have become popular over traditional websites. Even with good content management systems like WordPress running a website is pretty tough. If thegrid can improve on this situation they will have a good future.
</li><li>My biggest criticism of what I've seen so far from thegrid that their software, from what it seems, is going to be proprietary and closed source. This is not good. And this has the potential to bring up fundamentally the same issues that occur with the likes of Facebook and Twitter. The upside of their design is that it seems like their software does output static files that can be hosted on other platforms and which are relatively easy to migrate between content management systems. The output format appears to be compatible with Jekyl. But for any platform I use for mission critical stuff, or projects like this blog where I put large amounts of time into it, open source Free Software (in the RMS way) is a must. The fact that thegrid software looks like it will be proprietary severely limits the use cases that I have for it. For a program like this the ability to leave their platform about undue stress is as important as the functionality that their platform provides. I do not want to be trapped in another content silo.
</li><li>Looking at their list of developers; their team seems experienced. It seems like it is within in their skill to deliver on what they are promising. It does not look like this is going to be one of the scams that has plagued crowd sourcing efforts.
</li><li>I really don't like their buzzword filled way of describing their product. They like to use words and phrases like "artificial intelligence" and "websites that design themselves" to really mean "content management system". This makes me substantially skeptical of their product.
</li><li>They have released a few sample websites designed with their engine. These websites seemed generally pretty clean in terms of layout generally have no major design issues. However, layout does seem substantially different in your typical blog or personal website.
</li><li>For this type of thing, the level of customizability is going to be pretty critical. If their engine only has a few possible layouts and designs that can do it's going to be limited to the world of novice users who lack the technical skill in use anything better, or people working on websites so simple they have no use for anything more sophisticated.
</li><li>It seems like they are trying to shake up some of the more fundamental parts of how CMSes function. Their way of handling themes is radically different than the typical implementation. This type of exploration can on
</li><li>A lot of commentators on this, and to some extent developers of thegrid themselves, think that this type of program will replace the role of web designers. I strongly doubt this, they may come up with a way to automate some of the more routine tests that web designers do, but fundamentally creative work still require humans at least to be done with perfection. The best this type of program can hope to do is to leverage the worse is better effect -the fact that her sound the desired functionality can often be delivered by 20% of the effort. This will not be a threat to most web designers, just as the role of cheap and efficient automated translation by services like Google Translate, is not a threat to human translators. This type of software will either be a help to web designers by simplifying some more routine tasks, and/or it will be the type of software used in markets where people can't afford the full effort of a web designer. Web designers and other creative workers will keep their jobs, improved content management systems or not.</li></ul><p><a href="../../tag/freesoftware.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#freesoftware</a> <a href="../../tag/googletranslate.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#googletranslate</a> <a href="../../tag/rms.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#rms</a> <a href="../../tag/scienceandtech.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#scienceandtech</a></p></div>                    </div>
