<p>About a month ago I discussed <a title="What Would the Ideal Distributed Social Networking Application Look Like?" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140403093812/%3Ca%20href=" https:>https:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>theojones.name/<wbr></wbr>index.php/<wbr></wbr>2013/<wbr></wbr>12/<wbr></wbr>30/<wbr></wbr>ideal-distributed-social-networking-application-look-like/<wbr></wbr></a>"&gt;the need for a distributed social networking application. At the time I wrote that article there were no social networking systems around that were reasonably easy to install, secure, and with a usable feature set. I just found out about<a href="http://twister.net.co/"> a new application, Twister, that </a>comes close to meeting these goals. Its open source, and it seems to be easy to write software that interfaces with it. It is fully decentralized and its server can run on a regular computer without the need for an always on server.  Its main flaw seems to be that there is no way to to run a web based interface for it from a remote computer. This means that it is currently impossible to have a website that you can just go to and register an account at without installing anything on your computer. However, I have done a bit on coding over the weekend and I think this issue is pretty tractable. I have written an application in Python that can allow users to view Twister profiles over the web and I have , eventually I will post this code, and time permitting I may turn this into a full hosted web based interface for Twister that accounts can be registered at. In the rest of this post I will discuss some of the flaws and possibilities with this network. I will then discuss how to install it on Linux Mint (still not as easy a process as it could be).<br /><!--more--><br />The other clear limitation of Twister is that it has adopted the 140 character  limit from Twi<strong><em>tt</em></strong>er. This limits the depth and nature of the posts that can be made with this system. There are reasons to limit the size of messages, but 140 is too low. A social networking system should allow enough text to put a link with a solid paragraph of text. I reckon this would be about a limit of 1000 characters.</p>

<p>There is also no support for anything like Facebook's groups.This issue seems easy to code around because it would possible to just create a program that manages a page that posts out the content of any private messages sent to it. This program would also need to have the appropriate measures needed to drop the banhammer on the occasional idiot. This program would work in a similar way to GNU Mailman or other email mailing list managers.</p>

<p>The private messaging features in twister are weak. It does not allow anyone who you are not already following to message you, but in any messaging system there are reasons to want the ability to message people that you have not already been in contact with. It is harder to code around this issue, but the use of relays that people can follow may be one way to code around this limitation.It may even be true that private and public messaging is so totally different that it would be better to write separate application to handle each task.</p>

<p>Profiles have very few options.</p>

<p>The loss of a private key means the loss of your profile. There therefore needs to be a way to back up this key. A program that uses Shamir's Secret Sharing or a similar algorithm to split a backup of the key into pieces and then distributes these pieces among the user's friends  may be one easy way to resolve these issues.</p>

<p>I have found that the best way to interface with the Twister RPC is not through the Twister author's suggested python-bitcoin (which is really just a JSON RPC client) ,but instead is through the pyjsonrpc library. Here is some Python code to grab the contents of user profiles and format it into HTML that I wrote with this library: (wordpress doesn't seem to handle the formatting of python code very well, eventually I'll create a GitHub repository for this).</p>

<p>http_client = pyjsonrpc.HttpClient( <br />url = "http://localhost:28332", <br />username = "user", <br />password = "pwd" <br />)</p>

<p>def GetRawProfileJSON(UserNameToLookUp): <br />return http_client.call("dhtget", UserNameToLookUp, "profile", "s") <br />def GetParsedProfileJSON(UserNameToLookUp): <br />return GetRawProfileJSON(UserNameToLookUp)[0]['p']['v']</p>

<p>def GetFullNameHtml(ParsedProfileJSON): <br />global PageTitle <br />FullName = ParsedProfileJSON['fullname'] <br />PageTitle = FullName + "  Profile" <br />return "</p>
<h1>Name</h1><h2>" + FullName + "</h2>
<p><br />" <br />def GetUrlHtml(ParsedProfileJSON): <br />url = ParsedProfileJSON['url'] <br />return "</p>
<h1>Website</h1><h2>" + url + "</h2>
<p><br />" <br />def GetLocationHtml(ParsedProfileJSON): <br />loc = ParsedProfileJSON['location'] <br />return "</p>
<h1>Location</h1><h2>" + loc + "</h2>
<p><br />" <br />def GetBioHtml(ParsedProfileJSON): <br />bio = ParsedProfileJSON['bio'] <br />return "</p>
<h1>About Me</h1><h2>" + bio + "</h2>
<p><br />"</p>

<p>def GetProfileHTML(UserNameToLookUp): <br />parsed = GetParsedProfileJSON(UserNameToLookUp) <br />return GetFullNameHtml(parsed) + GetUrlHtml(parsed) + GetLocationHtml(parsed) + GetBioHtml(parsed)</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Installing this program is easier than most other distributed social networking apps but still a pain. Here is how I did it on Linux Mint.</p>

<p>sudo apt-get install git</p>

<p>sudo apt-get install autoconf</p>

<p>sudo apt-get install automake</p>

<p>sudo apt-get install libtool</p>

<p>sudo apt-get install g++</p>

<p>sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev</p>

<p>sudo apt-get install libssl-dev</p>

<p>sudo apt-get install libdb5.3++ libdb5.3++-dev</p>

<p>sudo apt-get install miniupnpc</p>

<p>sudo apt-get install libminiupnpc-dev</p>

<p>sudo apt-get install libglibmm-2.4-dev</p>

<p>git clone <a href="https://github.com/miguelfreitas/twister-core.git"></a><a href="https://github.com/miguelfreitas/twister-core.git">https:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>github.com/<wbr></wbr>miguelfreitas/<wbr></wbr>twister-core.git</a></p>

<p>cd twister-core</p>

<p>./bootstrap.sh</p>

<p>./configure --enable-logging --enable-debug</p>

<p>make</p>

<p>make will take a while</p>

<p>mkdir ~/.twister</p>

<p>cd ~/.twister</p>

<p>The reason why a simple GIS program completely flatted the crap hardware in a room full of Macbooks during one of my classes, while still somehow not leaving me on my Linux box guessing which fuzzy blur is supposed to be a medial morane, or the reason why my physics professor went on a rant about the b0rked output that Apple's word processor produces must be that Macs are so great at dealing with scientific data.</p>

<p>Ah yes DNA imaging on a Mac, the garbage that inspired today’s rant. Watch that bioinformatics software crawl, watch it wither, watch it crash. Now lets go on to Apple's description of their</p>

<p>Apple is nice enough to use a hard drive type that is incompatible with every other laptop on the market. This helps them charge you the special Mac user price on your upgrades. Oh, and don't forget the soldered RAM that is not replaceable by the user. Some things haven't changed since the days of the old Macs that I remember using in elementary school.</p>

<p>[caption id="attachment_1003" align="aligncenter" width="480"]<a href="http://cexx.org/snicker/macpix.htm"></a> Except for the monitor this is still as true now as it was in 1998. Via <a href="http://cexx.org"></a><a href="http://cexx.org">http:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>cexx.org</a>]</p>

<p>Now lets visit the <a href="http://www.apple.com/osx/">Mac OS X page</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>OS X is the operating system that powers every Mac. Built on a rock-solid UNIX foundation</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As far as I can tell the "UNIX foundation" in OS X consists of two things</p>
<ol><li>Buying the rights to the UNIX trademark so Apple can call their crappy bloatware OS UNIX</li>
    <li>Copying and pasting a bunch of code from operating systems that <em>actually</em> have a "rock-solid UNIX foundation" like Linux and BSD</li>
</ol>
<p>Apple doesn't obey the fundamental rules that guide the design of <em>real</em> UNIXes. These principles are famously summed up by Doug McIlroy as follows "This is the Unix philosophy: Write programs that do one thing and do it well. Write programs to work together. Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface."</p>

<p>Instead of writing programs that do one thing and do it well, Apple prefers to write bloatware that does many things but none of it well. Instead of writing programs to work together and use text for input and output, Apple writes programs that output weird proprietary file formats, and that refuse to work with command line interfaces.</p>
<blockquote>
<p> it’s engineered to take full advantage of what the hardware is capable of.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hmm. Mac OS more seems built to burn through the RAM and run slow.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And it’s designed to deliver the most intuitive and integrated computer experience in the world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wonder if Apple should design their user interfaces in a way that actually allows people to get real work done instead of nerfing their OS into an "intuitive" environment for lusers who refuse to learn how their computer actually works.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you already use an iPhone or iPad, a Mac will feel instantly familiar.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sure. But I use my Ipad as an appliance for web browsing and other simple tasks. However, I expect to get real work done on my laptop.</p>

                    <p class="reading">
                <span class="vague">9 min read </span>
            </p>
            <p>Time's <a href="http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,2164806-1,00.html">most recent cover article</a> was about a quantum computer produced by startup D-Wave. However, this article is deeply flawed and represents severe problems that pervade science journalism  </p><ol><li>Time's writer has no expertise in the relevant subject matters. Quantum computing involves very complex issues in computer science and physics. Time assigned the story to their book critic who has a degree in literature.</li>
    <li>Time's story gives equal weight to the claims made in D-Wave's advertising, and to the relevant published research done by independent computer scientists and physicists. The academic research gives strong reasons to doubt the plausibility of many of D-Wave's claims.</li>
    <li>The story has a multitude of outright errors and misleading statements.</li>
</ol><p>D-Wave has developed a special purpose quantum computer. The computer you are reading this on is a general purpose computer -- it can do any mathematical calculation that you want. On the other hand D-Wave's computer is optimized to solve only one problem, discrete combinatorial optimization, which has applications in engineering. D-Wave's computer can do one thing that your computer cannot, use quantum mechanical effects to aid the solving of this problem. There is however one problem that did not get enough play in Time's story, independent researchers have not been able to verify that D-Wave's quantum computer is any better at solving this problem than a classical computer, or even that quantum computers in general are better at this problem.</p><!--more--><p>The issues with the Time article start with the first paragraph.  </p><blockquote>
<p>For years astronomers have believed that the coldest place in the universe is a massive gas cloud 5,000 light-years from Earth called the Boomerang Nebula. ...</p>

<p>But as it turns out, the scientists have been off by about 5,000 light-years. The coldest place in the universe is actually in a small city directly east of Vancouver called Burnaby.</p>
</blockquote><p>Two issues here  </p><ol><li>The Boomerang is the the coldest known <em>natural</em> object, artificial experiments have long gone below this level</li>
    <li>The internals of the D-Wave computer are <em>NOT</em> the coldest man-made object</li>
</ol><p>Now lets look at the last paragraph of the article preview  </p><blockquote>
<p>The reason D-Wave has so few customers is that it makes a new type of computer called a quantum computer that's so radical and strange, people are still trying to figure out what it's for and how to use it. .... it has the potential to solve problems that would take conventional computers centuries, with revolutionary consequences for fields ranging from cryptography to nanotechnology, pharmaceuticals to artificial intelligence.</p>
</blockquote><p>I'm tempted to tone down the flameage on this one because the issues in this paragraph are corrected later in the article. However, this is the last paragraph that is below the fold. So, this will be as far as many readers read. And this paragraph is incorrect when taken by itself. As I noted above, the D-Wave is a special purpose computer. Its not useful at running Shor's algorithm, or Grover's algorithm -- the two quantum algorithms with relevance to cryptography. It can just solve the discrete combinatorial optimization problem, which has much more limited use.  </p><blockquote>
<p>.... But D-Wave's customers buy them anyway, for around $10 million a pop, because if they're the real deal they could be the biggest leap forward since the invention of the microprocessor.</p>
</blockquote><p>Same issue here. Classical computers do a lot more than just solve one math problem.</p><p>The discussion of the history of quantum mechanics is pretty good. There is one sentence that I would take exception to  </p><blockquote>
<p>Einstein ultimately found quantum mechanics so monstrously counterintuitive that he rejected it as either wrong or profoundly incomplete. As he famously put it, "I cannot believe that God plays dice with the world."</p>
</blockquote><p>Einstein didn't reject quantum mechanics, he argued for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensemble_Interpretation">ensemble interpretation</a> which attempts to explain quantum effects in terms of statistical aggregates of particles.  </p><blockquote>
<p>The supercooled niobium chip at the heart of the D-Wave Two has 512 qubits and therefore could in theory perform 2<sup>512</sup> operations simultaneously.</p>
</blockquote><p>Bzzt!! Quantum computers don't do 2<sup>512</sup> operations simultaneously. The quantum computer does an operation that pretty much amounts to randomly guessing at the right answer. The qubits then undergo what is known as entanglement.  At this point you can imagine  2<sup>512</sup> parallel universes with their own parallel qubits. These "virtual" qubits interact, and eventually they decohenere into a state where only one set of qubits is observed. At first glance it looks like you just have quantum <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogosort">bogosort</a> -- most of the possible guesses are incorrect. But in fact, during the period of time when the "virtual" qubits are entangled and interacting, and when the problem being solved follows certain patterns it is possible to "stack the deck" and increase the probability that the correct answer will be the one observed.  </p><blockquote>
<p>One of the documents leaked by Edward Snowden, published last month, revealed that the NSA has an $80 million quantum-computing project suggestively code-named Penetrating Hard Targets. Here's why: much of the encryption used online is based on the fact that it can take conventional computers years to find the factors of a number that is the product of two large primes. A quantum computer could do it so fast that it would render a lot of encryption obsolete overnight. You can see why the NSA would take an interest.</p>
</blockquote><p>Correct but confusing. Contrary to the impression that you would get so far in the article, the D-Wave computer cannot solve these cryptographic problems.</p><p>The article then goes into a two-page speel about how great the inventors of the D-Wave computer how, and how great the technique they invented is. -- All without any mention of the objection from the academic community.  </p><blockquote>
<p>For example, you can't as yet perform the kind of cryptographic wizardry the NSA was interested in, because an adiabatic quantum computer won't run the right algorithm. It's a special-purpose tool. "You take your general-purpose chip," Rose says, "and you do a bunch of inefficient stuff that generates megawatts of heat and takes forever, and you can get the answer out of it. But this thing, with a picowatt and a microsecond, does the same thing. So it's just doing something very specific, very fast, very efficiently."</p>
</blockquote><p>Finally on page five out of eight.  </p><blockquote>
<p>This is great if you have a really hard discrete combinatorial optimization problem to solve. Not everybody does. But once you start looking for optimization problems, or at least problems that can be twisted around to look like optimization problems, you find them all over the place: in software design, tumor treatments, logistical planning, the stock market, airline schedules, the search for Earth-like planets in other solar systems, and in particular in machine learning.</p>
</blockquote><p>No mention of how no one has been able to prove that quantum computers can actually solve the discrete combinatorial optimization problem in a way thats appreciably more effective than classical computers.</p><p>The article then continues on about how great the D-wave people are, and how big name companies have bought their stuff for another page.</p><p>On the last page of the article Time gets to D-Wave's critics, but portrays them as a bunch of ivory tower eggheads that are a bit too removed from real life -- instead of a sizeable portion of those who are capable of evaluating D-Wave's claims.  </p><blockquote>
<p>Another challenge rose and company face is that there is a small but nonzero number of academic physicists and computer scientists who think that they are partly or completely full of sh-t. Ever since D-Wave's first demo in 2007, snide humor, polite skepticism, impolite skepticism and outright debunkings have been lobbed at the company from any number of ivory towers. "There are many who in Round 1 of this started trash-talking D-Wave before they'd ever met the company," Jurvetson says.</p>
</blockquote><p>Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.  </p><blockquote>
<p>Any blog post or news story about D-Wave instantly grows a shaggy beard of vehement comments, both pro- and anti-.</p>
</blockquote><p>Yup.  </p><blockquote>
<p> The critics argue that D-Wave is insufficiently transparent,</p>
</blockquote><p>Then D-Wave should release more information about how their computer works. Reproducibility of your results is an important part of science.  </p><blockquote>
<p>that its adiabatic approach is unpromising, that its machines are no faster than classical computers</p>
</blockquote><p>Then they should release evidence that quantum computers can solve the discrete combinatorial optimization problem faster than a classical computer. <br />
Lets check what actual physicists say about this dispute then.  </p><blockquote>
<p>Last month a team including Matthias Troyer, an internationally respected professor of computational physics at ETH Zurich, attempted to clarify things with a report based on an extensive series of tests pitting Google's D-Wave Two against classical computers solving randomly chosen problems. Verdict? To quote from the study: "We find no evidence of quantum speedup when the entire data set is considered and obtain inconclusive results when comparing subsets of instances on an instance-by-instance basis." This has, not surprisingly, generally been interpreted as a conspicuous failure for D-Wave.</p>
</blockquote><p>But this analysis would not be complete without looking at more of D-Wave's advertising, would it?  </p><blockquote>
<p>But where quantum computing is concerned, there always seems to be room for disagreement.</p>
</blockquote><p>No. Where journalists are involved there always seems to be room for disagreement.  </p><blockquote>
<p>The attitude in D-Wave's C-suite toward all this back-and-forth is, unsurprisingly, dismissive. "The people that really understand what we're doing aren't skeptical," says Brownell. Rose is equally calm about it; all that wrestling must have left him with a thick skin. "Unfortunately," he says, "like all discourse on the Internet, it tends to be driven by a small number of people that are both vocal and not necessarily the most informed."</p>
</blockquote><p>Thats some real peer reviewed research Time has there. A D-Wave employee saying that "The people that really understand what we're doing aren't skeptical" really proves that their computer works.</p><p><a href="../../tag/bzztquantum.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#bzztquantum</a> <a href="../../tag/edwardsnowden.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#edwardsnowden</a> <a href="../../tag/matthiastroyer.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#matthiastroyer</a> <a href="../../tag/nsa.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#nsa</a> <a href="../../tag/old.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#old</a> <a href="../../tag/old.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#old</a> <a href="../../tag/uncategorized.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#uncategorized</a></p></div>                    </div>

            </p>
            
<p>The Trans-Pacific Partnership is a proposed trade agreement involving multiple countries bordering the Pacific Ocean. These countries include the United States, Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore.  However, this agreement is not just about trade. It contains multiple riders relating to copyright, trademark, patent, and anti-trust law. Some of these riders will also serve to censor journalists and researchers, particulary those who study computer security. I believe that these riders will have effects that are harmful enough to erase the benefits of the increased trade that the treaty may bring. The trade parts of the treaty are good, the riders are not. In this post I will briefly discuss the reasons why I generally support free trade. I will then discuss some of the problematic parts of this agreement.  <br /><!--more--></p>
<h3>My General Opinions On Trade</h3><p>I believe that in general <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/economy/economy-lab/imports-are-a-benefit-exports-are-a-cost-is-it-clear-now/article614908/">imports are a benefit to the economy and exports are not a benefit, but instead the cost of imports</a>. Trade provides the economy tangible goods that can only be produced in the domestic economy at a high cost if at all. I believe that a majority of the trade barriers which remain in the economy primarily "protect" skilled industries.Protectionism harms the economy. It causes consumers to pay more, and because protectionism harms domestic industries that rely on imported materials it can serve as more of a job swap than job protection. An economy in free trade will tend to focus on its most productive industries, and thereby maximize its productivity.</p><p>There are only a handful of cases where I believe that trade restrictions may be justified and none of these cases are protectionist.For example, a government may enact a humanitarian trade restriction, such as a trade sanction designed to deter a human rights violation. Some trade and immigration restrictions may be necessary to give nations policy space to enact needed programs or to protect global economic stability. These may include capital controls designed to restrict speculative transactions that destabilize markets, or possibly some restrictions on immigration designed to limit migrant inflows to a level that an economy has the ability to sustain itself without excessive disruption. Some trade restrictions may also be necessary to develop domestic industry, to allocate limited foreign capital resources in an optimal way, or to phase out a trade policy that cannot be sustained in the long run. Restrictions of this form may be more necessary in developing nations or small nations with limited economic resources.</p><p> </p><h3>The TTP and Free Speech</h3><p>Article 4 of the latest draft of the TTP prohibits the development or publication of technology or methods that serve to "enable or facilitate" the circumvention of a computer security system. This could have a severe chilling effect on discussion and education about computer security. Even though there is a narrow exemption for research this provision could be used to intimidate scholars looking into computer security issues. Even worse would be the effect  on journalists, as there is no exemption for their work. Journalists would be restricted in their ability to discuss computer security issues and would need the approval of the software developer before they could publish information about security  vulnerability in a computer program. J<a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2007/05/09-f9-legal-primer">udicial interpretation of similar</a>, but more narrow, laws already on the books in the United States suggests that the TPP could make it illegal for bloggers or journalists to even link to websites that publish software that can be used to disable copy protection.</p><p>This provision would also restrict the ability of librarians to archive books and other works which are protected by copy protection. The provision of the treaty which applies penalties to anyone who “distributes, imports for distribution, broadcasts, communicates or makes available to the public copies of works [protected by DRM when the DRM has been disabled]” would completely prohibit librarians from making these archives open to the public.</p><p><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/08/new-leaked-tpp-puts-fair-use-risk">The TPP would reduce the fair use restrictions that allow excerpts of copyrighted works to be used for "criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship and research".  </a>  </p><h3 style="text-align: center;">Copyright, Patent, and Trademarks</h3><p><a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/tpp">The treaty would have other effects on copyright law</a>. It would  </p><ol><li>Enhance the liability put on ISPs for the actions of their users, and would make it easier for people who claim a copyright to force ISPs to remove their users' data. This takedown procedure would have little to no independent oversight and would have few protections against false claims.</li>
    <li>It would expand copyright terms  to the life of the author plus 70 years.</li>
    <li>It would <em>prohibit</em> the resale of copyrighted works between countries without the permission of the copyright holder, even when the copies were legally purchased.</li>
</ol><p>The treaty would also expand the scope of patent law by  </p><ol><li>Lowering the standards needed for an invention to receive a patent. The TPP declares that “patents shall be available for any new forms, uses, or methods of <strong>using a known product</strong>; and may satisfy the criteria for patentability, <strong>even if such invention does not result in the enhancement of the known efficacy of the product</strong>.” (emphasis added)</li>
    <li>The treaty also expands the scope of genetic patents. It declares that patents may be granted on “plants and animals”.</li>
    <li>It also expands the scope of medical patents and allows patents on “diagnostic, therapeutic, and <strong>surgical methods</strong> for the treatment of humans or animals.” Emphasis added.</li>
</ol><p>Trademarks are also expanded.“No Party may require, as a condition of registration, <strong>that a sign be visually perceptible</strong>, nor may a Party deny registration of a trademark solely on the grounds that the sign of which it is composed is a sound or a scent.” Emphasis added.</p><p> </p><p>I will discuss the anti-trust and regulatory implications of the treaty in a later post.</p><p><a href="../../tag/freespeech.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#freespeech</a> <a href="../../tag/newzealand.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#newzealand</a> <a href="../../tag/old.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#old</a> <a href="../../tag/old.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#old</a> <a href="../../tag/tpp.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#tpp</a> <a href="../../tag/uncategorized.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#uncategorized</a> <a href="../../tag/unitedstates.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#unitedstates</a></p></div>                    </div>

<p>50 years ago this month Lyndon Johnson gave his War on Poverty speech, which was the beginning of most of the U.S government's anti-poverty programs. While these programs have made a clear dent in poverty, they have not come close to eliminating poverty. We need to do more. In this post I will detail how America can solve the poverty issue.</p>
<ol><li>The U.S government should commit to alleviating unemployment and maintaining full employment. This should include
<ol><li>The creation of a Works Progress Administration style jobs program that would be able to offer every unemployed person who is willing and able to work a job at a living wage. This program would employ the workers on infrastructure programs, providing public services, and projects done in collaboration with private non-profit groups. This program should continue even after the effects of the recession are over.</li>
    <li>The government should provide grants to unemployed workers and low income individuals who intend to start a business. This program would evaluate proposals based on their cost, the number of people employed by the businesses, and the benefit to the public that would be created by the proposals.</li>
    <li>The U.S government should aggressively use monetary policy to encourage private investment. This should include a continuation of the zero interest rate policy -- possibly indefinitely.</li>
    <li>The government should aggressively use fiscal policy to keep the economy at full employment. This should include increased deficits when the economy is sluggish and reduced deficits/ surpluses when there is a high risk of inflation.</li>
</ol></li> <br /><li>The current set of anti-poverty programs<a title="The Best Way to Eliminate Poverty in the United States" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140326141202/%3Ca%20href=" https:>https:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>theojones.name/<wbr></wbr>index.php/<wbr></wbr>2013/<wbr></wbr>09/<wbr></wbr>17/<wbr></wbr>best-way-eliminate-poverty-united-states/<wbr></wbr></a>"&gt; should be replaced with a basic income program that would provide a universal cash grant to all U.S adult citizens that is delivered unconditionally and without means testing  .</li>
    <li><a title="What should be done with the U.S health care system?" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140326141811/%3Ca%20href=" https:>https:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>theojones.name/<wbr></wbr>index.php/<wbr></wbr>2014/<wbr></wbr>01/<wbr></wbr>05/<wbr></wbr>done-u-s-health-care-system/<wbr></wbr></a>"&gt;A universal health care system should be adopted. </li>

<p>Last month <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/07/world/asia/japans-parliament-approves-a-secrecy-law-amid-protests.html">Japan's parliament passed a secrecy law</a> which dramatically increases the range of documents that are kept secret in Japan and increases penalties for leaking documents. The law's definition of what constitutes a secret is vague and the law gives government agencies broad latitude in classifying material. The law's broadness and vagueness, and the harsh -- up to 10 years in prison -- penalties that come with it may be used to harass journalists and whistle-blowers.  <br /><!--more--></p>

<p>Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's government is planning a state secrets act that critics say could curtail public access to information on a wide range of issues, including tensions with China and the Fukushima nuclear crisis.  <br />....<br />"Basically, this bill raises the possibility that the kind of information about which the public should be informed is kept secret eternally," Tadaaki Muto, a lawyer and member of a task force on the bill at the Japan Federation of Bar Associations, told Reuters.</p>
</blockquote><p>It seems like this new legislation will crimp free speech and freedom of information in Japan and it comes in the aftermath of America's NSA scandal, which shows the important role that whistle-blowers can have in journalism.</p><p><a href="../../tag/china.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#china</a> <a href="../../tag/freespeech.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#freespeech</a> <a href="../../tag/old.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#old</a> <a href="../../tag/old.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#old</a> <a href="../../tag/tadaakimuto.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#tadaakimuto</a> <a href="../../tag/uncategorized.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#uncategorized</a></p></div>                    </div>
