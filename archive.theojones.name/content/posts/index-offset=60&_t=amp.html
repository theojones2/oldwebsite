<p>I've seen a lot of el cheapo Ethernet cabling on Amazon and other places that uses  "copper clad aluminum" wiring instead of copper. This is a bad idea for quality, breaks Ethernet standards, and if you run POE through it, it can start a fire. This article does a good job of explaining the issue.<br /><a href="http://www.cetecglobal.com/technologies/cabling/cca.htm">http:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>www.cetecglobal.com/<wbr></wbr>technologies/<wbr></wbr>cabling/<wbr></wbr>cca.htm</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Gamergate’s zombie horde of trolls have struck again. This time, the target was Canadian journalist, author and PhD candidate Natalie Zed, slammed for trying to discuss gamergate for an entire conference without publicly saying the word: gamergate.</p>

<p>Last week, Zed attended the Canadian Game Studies Association’s 2015 conference as a panelist. In the opening comments, the organizers asked attendees to refrain from using the Gamergate hashtag, even though many of the panels were focused on the Gamergate phenomenon (depending on your perspective, either a debate about ethics in gaming, mostly focused on the sexism in games and gaming culture, or a vitriolic campaign of hatred directed at women who dare venture into the gaming industry).</p>

<p>The imposed twitter silence was an effort both to protect attendees from Gamergate troll hostility and to prevent Gamergaters from hijacking the online conversation about the conference, rendering Twitter useless for attendees.</p>

<p>Last week it came to the public's attention that a six-year-old child had contracted diphtheria in Spain, a disease not seen in Spain since 1987. Spain's El Pais is reporting now that the parents of the child, who had forgone vaccinating their child against diseases like diphtheria are more than contrite.</p>

<p>I've been seeing this issue invade Twitter and Facebook. I don't really have enough knowledge to evaluate the substance of the claim that the rape in the GOT episode was too much (I'm not a GOT watcher). But I'll chime in on the issue with a few points</p>

<p><strong>Note: When I talk of things like "free speech", "censorship" and "rights" in this post I mean ethics, not law. A number of the ethical rules I suggest regarding free speech would be difficult to encode into law.<br /></strong></p>

<p>1) Everyone has the right to criticize the media they watch. Others retain the right to dismiss the criticism as wrong headed. Criticism is not censorship.</p>

<p>2) Consumers of media have to right to not watch a TV show if they don't like it, or think that part of it is beyond the pale, or if they think it downplays rape. Even if wrong headed and irrational, the exercise of this preference is not censorship.</p>

<p>3) Censorship happens when this criticism turns into outside pressure, with two types of pressure counting. Direct coercion -- ie. by law and indirect coercion by deprivation of a generally shared resource.</p>

<p>4) I don't consider a publisher that exercises direct editorial control (such as a TV station) to be a generally shared resource. I'm fine if consumers try to lobby TV stations and other such publishers to make media that they like.</p>

<p>5) Things like YouTube, Twitter, and such are generally shared resources. I would consider an attempt to pressure YouTube into dropping clips of the rape scene to be an attempt at censorship, and unethical.</p>

<p>6) It seems to me like a lot of activists are under the impression that the best way to "avoid downplaying" rape is to purge the media and the arts of all references to it. Its a very ostrich head in sand way of looking at the issue and one that probably serves to actually downplay the issue. Rape happens, and art should reflect that.</p>

<p><a href="../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/486030422_bd28eb7e5e_o.jpg.html"><amp-img src="http://www.theojones.name/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/486030422_bd28eb7e5e_o.jpg" alt="486030422_bd28eb7e5e_o" width="769" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2463"></a>I am almost a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positivism">positivist</a>/empiricist in my philosophical beliefs, I believe that about the only reliable source of knowledge is observation, the scientific method, and the repeated refinement of theories through science. This applies even for human society. My one difference from this view is the belief that just raw observation isn't sufficient. There is the need for bridge assumptions in order to translate mere observations into explanatory theories and moral judgements. Additionally, some basic metaphysical assumptions are needed. The list of such assumptions should be as short as possible, and as much of the heavy lifting should be loaded on to observation. But these bridge assumptions are needed as just pure observation is not enough. A pile of data is not a theory and is not an explanation of the world. Mere observation is not sufficient to produce knowledge. Results need to be merged into something greater than their parts. Correlations between different results need to be drawn together into a greater theory. All this requires interpretation, and there needs to be rules that to interpretation. Likewise there have to be a few basic assumptions about how the world works in order to make science workable. Ethics is another thing where mere data isn't enough. The is-ought gap needs to be bridged. Therefore a basic assumption about how to turn facts about how the world is to ethical judgments is needed. As follows in the rest of this blog post is a rough overview of what my basic assumptions about the world is like. Additionally, a positivist/empiricist worldview without bridge assumptions will be unavoidably self-contradictory. There is no way that empiricism itself can be confirmed through mere observation.</p>
<ol><li>Physicalism --- all objects that exist follow laws of physics that exist independently of the subjective views of observers. My preferred variant of this is the mathematical universe hypothesis, the idea that the universe is a mathematical structure.</li>
    <li>The basic rules of logic.</li>
    <li>The scientific method. For this I prefer something along the lines of Popperlian falseificationsim. This is the idea that science is the repeated refinement of falsifiable theories through observation.</li>
    <li>A rule regarding ethics. I prefer preference utilitarianism – the idea that the moral set of actions is the one that results in the longest long-run preference satisfaction when aggregated over all individuals.</li>

<p>U.S. Rep. Katherine Clark unveiled legislation Wednesday that would require the Department of Justice to put more resources into prosecuting individuals who go online to stalk, harass or threaten others – particularly women.<br />Her bill would provide $4 million annually to hire and train more FBI agents to investigate and prosecute such cybercrimes. It would also require the Attorney General, FBI and U.S. Attorneys to make cybercrimes a priority.<br /> “Imagine while you are in our office people threaten to sexually assault you,” said Clark, D-Melrose. “We would never tolerate this in our offices, but this is a daily reality for women online.”</p>

<p>I think that issues with harassment, trolling and such on the internet are more common than in the offline world for two reasons. The first is that there is less accountability in the online world. Identities on the Internet are easily replaceable and expendable. This is not simply anonymity. Anonymity and accountability can coexist to a large degree. It is possible to be tied to an identity that is not your real name while still having a lot of stake in the continued reputation of that identity. The lack of accountability on the Internet is due to the lack of consequences for bad behavior. When a troll can just re-create a sock puppet account on the community he was banned from in order to troll again that's lack of accountability. When a Russian spammer can spew junk from easily replaceable IP addresses, that's lack of accountability. And the persistent lack of accountability and the easy replace ability of online identities is a major enabling factor in Internet harassment. If identities on the Internet had a strong cost to them trolls could no longer create burner accounts and would be substantially limited the damage he could do. Internet identity is a weird thing, sloughs few goods that is not scarce enough for the good of the public. If internet identities were scarcer, there would be less trolling. In the long run, although it is somewhat impractical to implement in the short term, the solution will be to make Internet identities scarcer. Create an Internet authentication service, which sells Internet identities and their authentication for a substantial but not prohibitive amount of money, like let's say, $50. This would prevent burner accounts. This may be a good role for a government agency. It would make banning users from Internet communities more effective. It would make it possible for different Internet communities to blacklist persistent trolls in a coordinated way. And it would add a substantial cost to trolling. The second factor that I think is huge and the growth of trolling and Internet harassment is the rise of content silos like Facebook and twitter. These websites are parked in the weird intermediate between web hosts/ISPs true Internet communities. A true Internet community like a forum or mailing list is perfectly able to just ban problem users, there are no shared subcommunities with different values. There are alternate routes for controversial speech. Web hosts in the other hand don't even need to deal with the content moderation issue. And web host, quite frankly, shouldn't even deal with what their users post as long as it's legal. There are limited ways that one user of a web host could damage the others. Content silos exist in a weird double state. They are too much like web hosts to be able to affect consistent moderation, they are close enough to proper Internet communities for problem users to be able to cause trouble for others. In short, content silos are the perfect outlet for the troll. They have very limited accountability for their actions, but plenty of room to do damage. As far as I can tell about the only way to prevent this effect is to get rid of such content silos. Centralizing massive amounts of Internet communities like the way that Facebook, twitter, Reddit and such does was bound to be a recipe for disaster. Content silos should be replaced with the decentralized web of yesteryear. Separate communities have their own websites that are isolated from others. The personal website should return. And decentralized protocols should replace the task done by social networking systems like messaging, contact management and profiles. This would allow more fine-grained control the side of the users, a more difficult situation for trolls.</p>
