      <title>Triangle-shaped political chart</title>

<p>A common alternative to a simple left-right anatomy of politics is a 2d chart, like the <a href="https://www.politicalcompass.org/analysis2">political compass.</a> Such a taxonomy divides political beliefs into two categories, one on an authoritarian/anti-authoritarian scale, and one on a left-right scale.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.politicalcompass.org/images/bothaxes.gif" alt="cartesian plane with horizontal left-right axis and vertical authoritarian-libertarian axis" width="400" height="400"></p>

<p>A benefit of this is that it can differentiate between ideologies that radically vary in their opinion of how society should be structured, but that are equally left/right wing. An anarchist-communist is, of course, quite different from a Soviet Union style communist. But it is hard to call one more left wing than the other. In terms of economic beliefs there is a great deal of symmetry between the two. But authoritarianism is an obvious differentiation between the two beliefs.</p>

<p>However, there is an issue with this. Authoritarianism and economic beliefs are connected.  In particular, I would suggest that a lot of the difference between left and right wing ideologies dissipates towards authoritarianism. You can see this in the likes of North Korea, which is strongly left wing, but yet, the authoritarian elements of this cause policies that seem very right-wing on first glance (for instance the strong cultural role of the military).  Or you can envision an Orwellian <em>1984</em> type totalitarianism that isn't clearly left or right wing.  Some of the conservatives that have tried to argue that fascism is left wing aren't totally off to see some symmetry between fascism and leftism. But this symmetry comes from the fact that extreme authoritarianism dilutes the difference between left and right. Likewise, I would say that about the strongest level of difference between two ideologies, would be that between leftist-anarchists, and right wing anarchists.</p>

<p>Instead of a square political spectrum, I would suggest a better shape would be a triangle. Complete <em>1984</em> style totalitarianism would be at the top, left-anarchism would be in the bottom left corner, and right-anarchism would be in the bottom right corner.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An unarmed man was shot in the head and critically wounded by Los Angeles police officers on Friday night, after he appeared to be flagging them down for assistance.</p>

<p>A passerby recorded graphic video of the incident from a car, and then posted it on Twitter. The video showed officers turning over the man, who appeared to be unconscious and lying on his face, and handcuffing his hands behind his back as his head bled profusely.</p>

<p>The Los Angeles police department said the man, who was not immediately named, had a towel wrapped around his hand and the two officers believed he was concealing a weapon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Its stuff like that that makes me hate cops. "He is asking me for help. How dare he trifle a cop with such a trivial thing.      <strong>blam</strong> "</p>

<p>In one of the few things I will commend them for, Uber has a multi-people per car service in some cities "UberPool" <a href="https://get.uber.com/cl/uberpool/">https:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>get.uber.com/<wbr></wbr>cl/<wbr></wbr>uberpool/<wbr></wbr></a><br />And its a good thing too because the share taxi/jitney is probably the most environmentally friendly form of transit around. If Uber can make such a thing common in the US I may forgive them for the other stuff.</p>

      <title>Top Five Differences Between Object Storage and Regular Web Hosting</title>

<p><a href="http://www.theojones.name/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/objectstorage.jpg"><img class="  wp-image-2416 alignright" src="http://www.theojones.name/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/objectstorage-300x225.jpg" alt="objectstorage" width="316" height="237"></a>In response to<a href="http://www.theojones.name/why-dedicated-podcast-hosting-services-are-a-dubious-idea/"> yesterday's post on podcast hosting</a>, I got a comment stating the flaws of regular webhosting for hosting podcasts. I agree with him that regular hosting is pretty bad for hosting large files like podcasts. My alternative is object storage services (S3, DreamObjects). These are designed to host large files. Sure, they usually charge for bandwidth. But its usually something small like five cents. And you will need viewers in the thousands for that to be substantial. And I would bet that there is some confusion between object storage and regular webhosting. So, in this post I will clarify the difference.</p>
<ol><li> <strong>Pricing regular webhosting charges a flat monthly fee</strong> Object storage charges based on usage.</li>
    <li> <strong>Metered versus unmetered storage and bandwith</strong> Object storage meters things like storage and bandwidth. Regular webhosting usually allows "unlimited" storage and bandwidth, but with limits on acceptable use of this storage and bandwidth.</li>
    <li><strong> Dynamic versus static content</strong> Object storage only holds static content (mp3s, videos, large files, html documents, etc). Full webhosting supports dynamic content (php, python, etc). You won't be able to install WordPress on object storage, but you will be able to do so on webhosting.</li>
    <li><strong>Suitability for a website</strong> You won't want to host your root website on a object storage system because the file names are often not suited to such a use Ie. <a href="https://objects.dreamhost.com/theopodcasts/uber_01_01.mp3">https:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>objects.dreamhost.com/<wbr></wbr>theopodcasts/<wbr></wbr>uber_01_01.mp3</a> (which is the url of one of my podcasts) But hosting full websites its the purpose of existence for webhosts</li>
    <li><strong>Suitability for large files and backups  </strong>Due to both hardware limitations of the servers allocated to web hosting, the software they use, and the limitations imposed by TOS agreements webhosting is poorly suited to storage large files. Hosting large files, however, is pretty much the point  of object storage. Likewise, you shouldn't backup to your webhost, but object storage providers often explicitly market to the backup market (see, for instance, <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/glacier/">Amazon's Glacier service</a>)</li>
</ol>
<p>In short, object storage won't be your main presence on the net, but it can store some of your larger files.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<div>
        
<p><a href="http://www.theojones.name/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/contract.jpg"><img class="  wp-image-2419 aligncenter" src="http://www.theojones.name/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/contract.jpg" alt="contract" width="638" height="327"></a>In a previous post<a href="https://www.theojones.name/some-basic-assumptions-of-mine-in-philosophy/">, I discussed what special assumptions</a> are needed to do logical reasoning about philosophy and factual matters. In that post I said some special assumption the bridge the is-ought problem would be needed. In this post I will discuss whatever that is really true, my conclusion will be quite possibly not. I believe that one could make an argument for moral realism somewhat <a href="http://bloggingheads.tv/videos/2346?in=49:59&out=58:34">along the lines of what Steve Pinker has said in an interview</a>. In effect the argument is that morality comes from basic elements of game theory is tempered by a social contract. Game theory is a inherent part of the world as applied by mathematics. The elements of game theory are likely to result in the prisoner’s dilemma type situations that result in moral reasoning are produced by inherent parts of how the laws of physics, chemistry, and biology work on the world. It’s a hybrid between traditional social contract type theories, and traditional moral realism. But in order to operate, such a moral theory doesn’t require any real assumptions beyond what is already known by way of science or other factual information.</p>

<p>This point of view has a few benefits. The first real benefit this point of view is that it avoids the problem of being too demanding. A lot of ethical and political theories have a huge issue that they tend to conform pretty poorly to human nature. Social contract type theories tend not to have this issue. The fact that they are produced by game theoretic bargaining between parties tends to eliminate this issue out of hand. A social contract type theory will tend to lack both the harsh moralizing that deontological ethical theories tend to provide, and the extreme demandingness of traditional utilitarianism.</p>

<p>The next benefit of this is that it’s a moral realist point of view. The elements of game theory embedded in this point of view exist independently of the subjective viewpoints of observers. This implies that morality itself, in some part, exists in a way this is independent of the subjective views of observers. This is both intuitively pleasing, and goes along with the many <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Normative-Web-Argument-Moral-Realism/dp/019958138X/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&qid=1434835336&sr=8-8&keywords=moral+realism">strong arguments for moral realism</a>.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the substantial sympathy I expressed in the previous post towards some form of preference utilitarianism, is in my opinion somewhat justified by this point of view. I think through a social contract something that looks a lot like fairly traditional preference utilitarianism will emerge, although, perhaps bounded by the Lockean proviso. And even better, this result will most likely emerge only as applied to the world of political philosophy – the place where the over demandingness of traditional utilitarianism does not rear its ugly head. In the world of politics, an assistance that everyone’s preferences be weighted equally by the state is not unreasonable. A derivatization of preference utilitarianism from contract theory is also able to resolve some of the most troubling dilemmas brought up by traditional utilitarianism. Issues like what types of preferences count for the purposes of moral reasoning, and how to deal with things like future generations. From the point of view of raw utilitarianism, there are no obvious solutions to such issues. However, from a social contract type point of view, it’s quite possible to reason through such problems. It’s a potentially a very clean and very elegant solution.</p>

However, I am not hosting it on a podcast hosting service. Why? The cost of it isn't worth the benefit. I looked at some podcast hosts, such as <a href="http://libsyn.com">libsyn </a>and <a href="https://www.blubrry.com/">Blubrry</a>. These services have advocates (See, for instance <a href="http://theaudacitytopodcast.com/best-podcast-hosting-tap133/">http:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>theaudacitytopodcast.com/<wbr></wbr>best-podcast-hosting-tap133/<wbr></wbr></a>) but I think there are better alternatives. Now, it is true that regular webhosting is a very bad idea for podcasts. Web servers like Apache tend not to be designed for the types of large file downloads that podcasts bring and they often use hardware (like SSDs) that isn't suited for bulk storage of large files. My alternative to dedicated hosts is object storage services, like <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon's S3 </a>and Dreamhost's <a href="https://www.dreamhost.com/cloud/storage/">DreamObjects</a>. Objectors to this will note that they charge for bandwidth. But do the math. The cheapest feature-rich podcast hosting service that I am aware of is libsyn's $5 per month plan. It provides 50mb of hosting, but with unlimited bandwidth. DreamHost will sell you 40gb of storage (which is quite plentiful) for $0.95 with bandwidth at 5¢/GB. Amazon's prices are similar (I use dreamhost, but have no strong preference between the two services). How many users will you need to come out worse with DreamObjects? Quite a few. Lets say you use your full libsyn 50mb and your subscribers download everything you post. You pay $5. For comparison a DreamObjects user could afford storage plus 80gb of bandwidth. Under these assumptions a Dreamhost user could support 1,600 users before libsyn looks better. In fact, services like libsyn are able to support the few heavy users because the vast majority of their users use less than they pay. The great majority of their users support the few.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Soon after the Treasury’s plan to replace Alexander Hamilton with a woman on the $10 bill was leaked last night, Twitter erupted with queries as to why Hamilton was getting the boot instead of Andrew Jackson, who many have campaigned to replace on the $20 with a woman and/or member of a minority group.</p>

<p>After all, Jackson owned slaves, slaughtered Native Americans, and detested banks, finance, and corporations. Hamilton, on the other hand, was a staunch abolitionist, helped found a school whose original mission was to assimilate Native Americans (today’s Hamilton College), and single-handedly placed the finances of the fledging nation on a solid footing.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theojones.name/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/uberharm.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2427" src="http://www.theojones.name/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/uberharm.jpg" alt="uberharm" width="640" height="360"></a>Uber recently lost an administrative decision in California over whether their drivers are independent contractors or employees. <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/dandiamond/2015/06/17/if-uber-drivers-are-employees-company-faces-hard-decision-on-health-care/">This could have very important implications for the company</a>. It would mean that the company is bound by a wide variety of regulations that fall on companies that hire employees. Uber would be bound to pay employees the minimum wage (regardless of the number of rides given), health benefits, it would be bound by working hours regulations, and many other regulation. Probably worst of all for the company, Uber would have to cover the business expenses of employees, or at least take them into account in tabulating wages paid. This was not a positive ruling for Uber. But to this outcome, I say it’s about time. Uber's entire business model is to ignore every regulation on their industry to keep costs down. Now, some of these regulations are useless. But Uber throws out the good with the bad. It’s nice to hear that regulators are finally "disrupting" them. Now, I will say that the conventional taxi system is pretty terrible. Where I live there aren't too many outright ripoff cab drivers, but there are ones that are 20 minutes late and which are otherwise unreliable. When you get to larger cities that are more dependent on cabs, it gets even worse some of the problems with cabs across the country is due to shitty regulations (hello, New York City medallion system). I can see why people like Uber and use their products, as they provide a very strong improvement over other taxi networks. However, as I said before they toss out the good with the bad in regards to regulations. In this post I’ll discuss some things I believe solidly that Uber should change with their business model.</p>

<p>The first big issue with Uber is their limited insurance for their drivers. There are very strong reasons why anyone driving for a business should have commercial insurance. Regular car insurance does not cover business driving. However, many of Uber’s drivers are driving illegally without the proper commercial insurance, posing strong legal risk to them, to consumers, and to other motorists. Fortunately, Uber has made some improvements on this issue recently by proving their drivers a limited secondary insurance policy for their Uber driving. But it’s not enough, and the coverage this provides is quite limited and poorly fits the legal requirements on commercial driving. This lack of insurance also serves to externalize costs on to the public. If an Uber driver gets into a car wreck while driving, both the victim of the car accident, and the driver have a huge problem. The driver has a large potential liability, while the victim of the car wreck will be left out to dry. The risk created by driving safety by Uber is unloaded onto the public.</p>

<p>The second major issue with Uber is their pricing scheme. All prices on Uber are set by the company. This is bad, because the price that optimizes Uber profits might not be the socially optimal price. In fact, if you accept Uber’s line that they are just a “platform” for independent contractors then, <a href="http://www.interfluidity.com/v2/5822.html">as the economics blogger Steve Waldman points out</a>, in effect Uber is a price-fixing cartel. A more flexible form of pricing set by the drivers is possible. Also, Uber’s pricing system is highly unstable because their surge level fluctuates a lot. I (along with most consumers I would guess) would prefer a much more predictable pricing system. But congestion pricing isn’t totally useless. It is useful to charge riders more for traveling at rush hour, in order to keep cars available for those who need to travel at that time. An intermediate solution is possible. A revision for Uber’s pricing system would involve the following, allow each driver to set his price for different categories of time (ie. Morning rush hour, evening rush hour, rest of the day, night time) but encourage drivers to refrain from changing their rates too much. This would also mean that all prices are human set, avoiding issues like what happened in Sidney, Australia where <a href="http://gawker.com/uber-turned-on-surge-pricing-for-people-fleeing-sydney-1671193132">Uber surged priced people fleeing a hostage situation</a>.</p>

<p>The third major issue with Uber is their tendency to off load a lot of their costs onto the drivers in a way that is nowhere near transparent. <a href="https://get.uber.com/cl/">Uber’s page recruiting new drivers</a> states, “<em>Got a car? Turn it into a money machine. The city is buzzing and Uber makes it easy for you to cash in on the action. Plus, you've already got everything you need to get started.</em>” An ad bought by Uber on the Bing search engine states that drivers “<em>Make Up To $17/hr In Fares</em>”. Of course, this claimed pay is highly misleading. It doesn’t take into account the cost of car maintenance (which not only increase with respect with miles driven, but also should be put to the higher standards of commercial driving). It also doesn’t take into account the cost of fuel, insurance, or other necessities of driving. Probably, the adjusted pay is more like 8-10 dollars per hour. The IRS estimates (for the purposes of tax deductions) that the <a href="http://www.irs.gov/Tax-Professionals/Standard-Mileage-Rates/">non-labor cost of business miles</a> is 57 cents per mile.</p>
