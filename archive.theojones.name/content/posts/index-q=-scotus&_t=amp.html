            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Well, the Indiana RFRA (Religious Freedom Restoration Act) passed. The whole debate on that legislation could easily be summed up by the Internet meme that says "the amount of energy to refute bullshit is an order of magnitude to bigger then to produce it".</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><amp-img src="http://www.theojones.name/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/032915_0751_OntheRecent1.jpg" alt=""></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The bill provides that religious belief exempts one from regulations, even neutral ones, unless the government produces a compelling need. Neither the Indiana bill nor its federal twin are particular to any type of regulation – and don't mention anti-discrimination issues. Probably 90% of the arguments from both sides in this issue are blatant nonsense. From some Internet discussions you would think people are talking about a different law. The opposition side produces bleating about the law being "a right to discriminate" law. The description of what they mean often has as little to do with the actual legislation, as screeching about how Obama care brings death panels. Especially considering that none of the 19 states that have almost identical legislation have ever granted an exemption to an antidiscrimination law based on a RFRA. It is extremely unlikely that the law will affect anti-discrimination law in any meaningful way. The side in favor of the law usually isn't much better. These people seem to think that religious freedom is under imminent attack. And even worse are the outright homophobic bigots who see in this law a chance that they will be able to do what they want. I have seen very few people discussing this bill who have shown the slightest bit of understanding of it. And even fewer people who have read it. Some of the actual issues brought up by the bill (which for various reasons I strongly disagree with) found to what extent religious exemptions be given to neutral laws are rarely discussed in any coherent degree. The whole debate is dominated by pure bullshit. The whole debate is just nonsense, and people who seem to be immune to logical or rational argument arguing with each other. And with this type of issue anything resembling actual argument doesn't last long against the backdrop of screeching howler monkeys.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">There are a lot of reasons to oppose RFRAs, but as far as I can tell the gay-rights stuff and anti-discrimination law stuff has little to do with the actual law (<a href="https://iga.in.gov/static-documents/9/2/b/a/92bab197/SB0101.05.ENRS.pdf">go read it, a lot of the media coverage on the subject is pretty misleading about the actual content</a>) -- unless the interpretation of the Indiana law differs radically from the interpretation of nearly identical laws in both federal law and the RFRAs in about a dozen other states. And despite that RFRAs have been on the books for about 20 years, no-one has been able to produce a non-overturned case where a RFRA weakened anti-discrimination law. In fact, courts have generally ruled that anti-discrimination passes strict scrutiny, making RFRAs irrelevant. And where the hell did the conception of this bill as an anti-gay one even come from? I don't really know. I think at least some of the proponents are under the impression that it will allow for exemptions to anti-discrimination laws and support it in part for that reason. I think some of the rage came from that (is public accommodation discrimination against gays even a thing? I haven't heard many real cases of it happening). And then there was the Arizona RFRA-ish bill which was really a stealth discrimination bill. If anyone has a good explanation for that tell it to me. This legislation is likely not just a useless repetition of current law. It goes far beyond what the Constitution mandates and even with the federal RFRA, a state RFRA has some effect. In City of Boerne v. Flores the Supreme Court struck down the part of the federal RFRA that applies to the states. But panicking over a state RFRA is a bit too much because we have a decade's worth of litigation over its federal version and good caselaw on what it means.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Neither the Indiana bill nor its federal twin are particular to any type of regulation and include pretty much all of law. I don't think either the federal RFRA or its state versions are a good idea. The idea of religious exemptions from neutral laws is almost always a bad idea. But that isn't what the discussion of the law seems to be focusing on. As I said before<a href="https://iga.in.gov/static-documents/9/2/b/a/92bab197/SB0101.05.ENRS.pdf">, this is a good issue to actually read the bill on, and to read</a> (or at least Wikipedia) some of the relevant court opinions. The bill is only four generously spaced pages long. The religious should not be exempted from neutral laws on the basis of religious belief and I oppose it. The Supreme Court has made it pretty clear that that the First Amendment does not allow people to ignore neutral laws on the basis of religious belief (with a handful of exceptions). See, for example, <em>Employment Division v. Smith</em>. The goal of RFRAs is to override that ruling (the federal RFRA was actually spawned by that ruling) and make actions conducted as a product of religious belief protected. Now, I strongly believe that SCOTUS got it right in Smith, and that RFRAs are fundamentally a bad idea, but the final decision belongs with the legislative branch. Lets look at what the 11-section Indiana bill (which is likely to pass) actually says as I go through a brief summary</p><p style="text-align: justify;">•Section 1: Says that the bill applies to all government laws and regulations, even ones made prior to the enactment of it.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">•Section 2: Only regulations particularly exempted by law are exempt.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">•Section 3: Definitions. Says that regulators are not allowed to use unconstutional provisions to work around the bill with particular mention of the establishment clause of the first amendment.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">•Section 4: More definitions. Pretty obvious and straightforward stuff.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">•Section 5. Defines "exercise of religion" as "any exercise of religion, whether or not compelled by, or central to, a system of religious belief".</p><p style="text-align: justify;">•Section 6: Defines "government entity".</p><p style="text-align: justify;">•Section 7: Defines "Person", includes corporations, but so does the federal RFRA. This right here is a good point to emphasize quite a bit. On internet forms I've seen a number of people who seem to think one of the defining characteristics of this RFRA versus the federal version, or the version in other states, is corporate personhood. It is not true. Like most other federal laws the federal RFRA relies on the Dictionary Act for its definition of "person". The dictionary act quite explicitly defines person to include corporations. <a href="http://www.yalelawjournal.org/forum/hobby-lobby-and-the-dictionary-act">Courts have ruled that no other part of the law overrides that</a>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">•Section 8: States that a governmental entity may not substantially burden a person's exercise of religion unless it meets strict scrutiny. (it's worth noting that the way that courts have actually ruled in regards to RFRAs makes the standard a lot more like intermediate scrutiny).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">•Section 9: People can sue over violations of the law.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">•Section 10: Government agencies can be ordered to pay damages to those affected.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">•Section 11: The bill does not limit the actions of private actors, only government actions, laws and regulations.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Section 8 is the core of the bill and most of the definition sections are mostly boilerplate. Section 8 is almost word for word identical to its counterpart in the federal RFRA.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In a follow up post, I will discuss some reasons why it is a dubious idea to grant religious exemptions to neutral laws and then I will discuss why it is extremely unlikely that the RFRA will ever be interpited to allow for discrimination.</p><p><a href="../../tag/dictionaryact.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#dictionaryact</a> <a href="../../tag/firstamendment.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#firstamendment</a> <a href="../../tag/politics.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#politics</a> <a href="../../tag/rfra.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#rfra</a> <a href="../../tag/scotus.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#scotus</a></p></div>                    </div>

<p>The Indiana legislature is considering a law that is very similar to the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act.  The bill provides that religious belief exempts one from regulations, even neutral ones, unless the government produces a compelling need. Neither the Indiana bill nor its federal twin are particular to any type of regulation and include everything from anti-discrimination laws to drug possession laws (the original inspiration for the federal RFRA). I don't think either law is a good idea. The idea of religious exemptions from neutral laws is almost always a bad idea. This is a good issue to actually read the bill on, and to read (or at least Wikipedia) some of the relevant court opinions. <a href="https://iga.in.gov/static-documents/9/2/b/a/92bab197/SB0101.05.ENRS.pdf">The bill is only four generously spaced pages long</a>.  The media coverage on this subject is pretty error ridden and contains a lot of misconceptions about what the bill actually says. The religious should not be exempted from neutral laws on the basis of religious belief and I oppose it. But, a lot of people fundamentally misunderstand what the bill actually says. A number of media outlets have claimed that it's an anti-gay bill (even though it does not directly touch on that subject, <a href="http://www.indystar.com/story/opinion/readers/2015/03/07/indiana-needs-religious-freedom-legislation/24477303/">and it likely will not affect anti-discrimination law in any meaningful way</a>). The point of this post will be to clarify a bit of the legal background, and to summarize the bill.  The Supreme Court has made it pretty clear that that the First Amendment does not allow people to ignore neutral laws on the basis of religious belief (with a handful of exceptions. See, for example, <em>Employment Division v. Smith</em>. The goal of RFRAs is to override that ruling (the federal RFRA was actually spawned by that ruling) and make actions conducted as a product of religious belief protected. Now, I strongly believe that SCOTUS got it right in Smith, and that RFRAs are fundamentally a bad idea, but the final decision belongs with the legislative branch.  Lets look at what the 11-section Indiana bill (which is likely to pass) actually says as I go through a brief summary</p>
<ul><li>Section 1: Says that the bill applies to all government laws and regulations, even ones made prior to the enactment of it. 
</li><li>Section 2: Only regulations particularly exempted by law are exempt.
</li><li>Section 3: Definitions. Says that regulators are not allowed to use unconstutional provisions to work around the bill with particular mention of the establishment clause of the first amendment. 
</li><li>Section 4: More definitions. Pretty obvious and straightforward stuff.

</li><li>Section 6: Defines "government entity". 
</li><li>Section 7: Defines "Person", includes corporations, but so does the federal RFRA.
</li><li>Section 8: States that a governmental entity may not substantially burden a person's exercise of religion unless it meets strict scrutiny
</li><li>Section 9: People can sue over violations of the law. 
</li><li>Section 10: Government agencies can be ordered to pay damages to those affected. 
</li><li>Section 11: The bill does not limit the actions of private actors, only government actions, laws and regulations.
</li></ul>
<p>Section 8 is the core of the bill and most of the definition sections are mostly boilerplate. This legislation is likely not just a useless repetition of current law. It goes far beyond what the Constitution mandates and even with the federal RFRA, a state RFRA has some effect. In <em>City of Boerne v.
