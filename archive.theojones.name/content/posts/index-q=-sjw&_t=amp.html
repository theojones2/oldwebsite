<p><a href="../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/socialjustice.jpg.html"><amp-img src="http://www.theojones.name/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/socialjustice.jpg" alt="socialjustice" width="1000" height="800" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2439"></a>The above image is a collage of three of the top results on Flickr for a search of the phrase "Social Justice". The <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sully_aka__wstera2/4478077831/">top-left image is from user wstera2 </a>and is titled "When liberals are losing a debate". The top right image is from user Takver and is titled "C<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/takver/5415825802/">hange, Freedom, Social Justice - Egypt Uprising protest</a>". The bottom image is titled "<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/rikkis_refuge/16400696138/">World Day for Social Justice</a>" and is via user Rikki's Refuge.</p>

<p>By its self, the phrase "social justice" is pretty meaningless. The phrase is effectively equivalent to the word "fairness". Try taking an article that uses the phrase and swapping out all occurrences of "social justice" for fairness. Very little meaning will be lost.    But "fairness" is an arbitrary concept. Almost every political ideology will perceive their goals as "fair".  Phrases like "social justice" are the political equivalent of "maximizing synergies" business speak. Such concepts are almost entirely dependent on ideology. What one will perceive as "fair" or "just is largely subjective in global terms. Every major political ideology has a different conception of the public good. Libertarians regard markets as properly "fair", others regard egalitarianism as "fair", and others take a roughly utilitarian perspective of the greatest good for the greatest number as "fair". However, the concept is still subjective.  In regards to talk of "fairness" in economic policy, <a href="http://blog.dilbert.com/post/102964895406/fairness-test">Scott Adams (the author of the Dilbert cartoon) made a similar point</a>. "<em>fairness is a concept invented so dumb people can participate in debates. Fairness isn't a natural law of the universe. It's a psychological problem. We sometimes get fairness confused with equality. Equality is usually good, and can often be measured with a satisfying precision. Fairness, on the other hand, is usually just a rationale for some sort of bias â€¦.It's just a psychological phenomenon that is easily manipulated.</em>"</p>

<p>However, there is one case where the phrase "social justice" carries more meaning than the word "fairness". The only meaning that is conveyed by that term is signaling about the speaker. Only certain ideologies refer to their goals as maximizing social justice. This gets us to pejoratives like "SJW".  So when a gater rants about "SJWs" they are attacking the ideologies refer to their goals as maximizing social justice. However, SJW is a strong pejorative. Using it is like saying "M$" in a discussion about Windows 10. It removes any indication that you are processing facts in a rational way and indicates that confirmation bias is at work. It's an inherently mocking tone, one that should only be used with clearly unreasonable positions. And treating reasonable positions as unreasonable destroys one's credibility.</p>

Its one defining  feature is its friendliness to trolls, and its extremely lax , anything goes moderation policy. Among the more notable members of this community are a large part of the active members of <a href="../../tag/GamerGate.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#GamerGate</a>, focused around the /<a href="http://8ch.net/gamergate/index.html">gamergate</a>/ board. However, there is a much more nefarious board, /<a href="http://8ch.net/baphomet/index.html">baphomet</a>/. That board has the purpose of a clearing house for doxing, harassment, trolling, and hacking. Its members care little for trivial things like ethics. The rules for the board note that "If you have remorse for you're  [sic] actions you are not welcome â€¦.We never show mercy during raids " and  "so if you're a attention whoring faggot this is not the place for you".  /Baphomet/ was founded by trolls and script kiddies saddened by the switch of focus of the hacking group Anonymous towards activism and away from nefarious destruction. Many members of the /gamergate/ chan are also /Baphomet/ users.  There is a close relationship between the two boards. /gamergate/ is the clean board that provides a respectiable public image for GG. /Baphomet/ has become the home for GG dirty tricks. Want to know what GG is really like? Lets  look into /baphomet/ a bit more <a href="http://8ch.net/baphomet/index.html"></a><a href="http://8ch.net/baphomet/index.html">http:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>8ch.net/<wbr></wbr>baphomet/<wbr></wbr>index.html</a> Note that /baphomet/ is just behind /gamergate/ on the top 25 list of 8chan fora.

I don't really want to just surrender my PC to a botnet that could be aimed at ANYTHINGâ€¦) if/when they changed (by working in conjunction with the driving force of the raid in IRC, ie people from /baphomet/).<br />Being able to generate a session should require an additional piece of software to act as a barrier to fucktards, that newfag idiots would be too retarded to find / too shitscared to download if they found it. That would leave the important shit in the hands of people who actually cared about it, while allowing anyone to join the public botnet (but not fire until the countdown timer hit 0 / other parameters were met)<br />This would allow widespread advertisement of the raid and new LOIC to anywhere that would listen, generating a large group of people all under the 'guidance' of /baphomet/, or a proxy group such as 4chan's /b/ for max lulz and 0 blame<br />Sorry if this makes no sense, I'm slightly very drunk. Anyway, I seem to recall Anonymous using something like this a few years back, but I don't know enough about this shit to be able to pass judgement. Regardless, I think the best way for us to actually advance ourselves as social justice warrior warriors is to gain the (unknowing) support of others.<br />Side note, would it be possible to encourage SJWs into ddossing what they thought was 8chan with a program like I suggested, but really have them hit their own shitty sites? We could then post proof to the owners / domain providers for lulz
