<p>An HIV vaccine developed in Canada <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130905155703/&lt;a%20href=" http:>http:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>communications.uwo.ca:80/<wbr></wbr>media/<wbr></wbr>releases/<wbr></wbr>2013/<wbr></wbr>September/<wbr></wbr>no_adverse_effects_in_volunteers_following_phase_i_clinical_trial_of_sumagen_aids_vaccine.html</a>"&gt;has passed a phase 1 clinical trial according to a press release by Western University, which conducted the research in collaboration with Sumagen. This clinical trial shows that the vaccine is safe to administer to humans and according to the press release "No serious adverse event was observed in any volunteer throughout the observation periods". A phase 1 trial</p>

<p>provides little information on the effectiveness of the vaccine and is only designed to detect severe side effects or safety issues. <!--more-->The vaccine is a genetically modified killed whole virus vaccine, which means that it relies on a modified version of the HIV virus which is more capable of triggering an immune response that results in immunity than an unmodified virus. The researchers report finding increased antibody production, providing some evidence that the vaccine is indeed effective. As stated in the press release</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The antibody against p24 capsid antigen increased as much as 64-fold in some vaccinees and antibody against gp120 surface antigen increased up to eight-fold after vaccination.</p>

<p>....</p>

<p>In particular, the antibody against gp120 surface antigen is considered to be very important, since some of these antibodies may represent the broadly neutralizing antibodies, which seem to be the most important parameter of an effective HIV vaccine for prevention of HIV-infection.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The researchers plan future trials to confirm that the vaccine is effective.</p>

<p>An effective vaccine would give public health officials a way to control the spread of AIDS.</p>

<p>It turns out that, despite their talk of liberty, libertarians have an awfully strong tendency to support dictators. Here are five examples of prominent libertarians shilling for, or supporting, authoritarian regimes.</p>
<ol style="font-size: medium;"><li><a style="font-size: medium;" href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2009/11/jeer-heer-has-a-ludwig-von-mises-quote.html">Lets start with what Ludwig von Mises had to say about Mussolini in his 1929 book <em>Liberalism</em></a>. "<em style="font-size: medium;">It cannot be denied that Fascism and similar movements aiming at the establishment of dictatorships are full of the best intentions and that their intervention has, for the moment, saved European civilization. The merit that Fascism has thereby won for itself will live on eternally in history.</em> "</li>
    <li><a style="font-size: medium;" href="http://www.counterpunch.org/2006/11/17/the-road-from-serfdom/">Libertarian economist Milton Friedman and his colleagues personally met with Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet and his policy advice became a "guiding light" for the dictator's economic policies. </a>After his role sparked public outrage in the United States Friedman stated that Pinochet's military dictatorship offered  "more room for individual initiative and for a private sphere of life" than the democratically elected government that preceded it.</li>
    <li>John Laughland, <a style="font-size: medium;" href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/04/25/the-ron-paul-institute-be-afraid-very-afraid.html">member of the advisory board of the Ron Paul Institute for Peace and Prosperity</a>, calls the NATO intervention against Slobodan Milosevic<a style="font-size: medium;" href="http://www.balkanstudies.org/articles/srebrenica-genocide-totem-new-world-order"> "A Totem for the New World Order" and denies that the genocide that triggered it ever took place</a>.He believes that the reason Milosevic was removed is that “Washington is promoting a system of political and military control not unlike that once practiced by the Soviet Union.”</li>
    <li>Lets switch from crazy uncle Ron's institute to his son. When interviewed about his opinions on the Syrian conflict <a style="font-size: medium;" href="http://littlegreenfootballs.com/article/42465_Rand_Paul-_We_Should_Leave_Assad_Alone_Because_Hes_Only_Killing_Muslims">Rand Paul had this to say</a> <em style="font-size: medium;">“I don’t see American interests involved on either side of this Syrian war. I see [Bashar] Assad, who has protected Christians for a number of decades, and Islamic rebels on the other side who have been attacking Christians</em>”. <a style="font-size: medium;" href="http://www.salon.com/2013/08/30/ron_paul_syria_is_a_false_flag/">Ron Paul thinks Assad may be getting set up </a> As a responce to the question “Oh, so you question whether Assad even used the gas, of if he’s just being set up?”, asked during an interview with Fox News. Paul responded  "<em style="font-size: medium;">just look at how many lies were told us about Saddam Hussein prior to that buildup. More propaganda. It happens all the time. I think it’s a false flag. I think really, indeed.</em>"</li>
    <li><a style="font-size: medium;" href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/2012/03/marwood-dent-a-pseudonym/thoughts-on-singapore/">Libertarian commentator Lew Rockwell published </a>an article praising Singapore on his website. The article stated that "<em>it is a myth that democracies (read: dictatorship of the masses) by definition offer more benevolent living conditions. In my experience, democracies have seeds of self-destruction. Singapore, on the other hand, is more like a family-run corporation – a political system I prefer over democracy. Here I don’t see any busybodies around. ....They are nowhere close to an ideal government, but compared to what you get elsewhere, Singapore is a treat.</em> " The article then discussed the political oppression and restrictions on freedom of speech in the single party state and argues that these restrictions are good for liberty "<em>Quite honestly, if more freedom of speech were allowed in Singapore, it would likely also degenerate into a 'dictatorship of the mobs' in which Peter lobbies or protests to steal what is Paul’s</em>."</li>

<p>[caption id="attachment_335" align="alignright" width="300"]<a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Noentanglements.jpg"></a> NO FOREIGN ENTANGLEMENTS anti-war protest sign prior to U.S. entry into WWII.[/caption]</p>

<p>The libertarian opposition to intervention in Syria and humanitarian interventions in other places brings up a fundamental contraction in libertarian political theory. Libertarians are unable to come up with a plausible theory of when it is acceptable for a state to intervene to prevent human rights violations in the territory of another.Almost all libertarians fall into either the <a href="http://thespeechatimeforchoosing.wordpress.com/2012/01/01/ron-paul-i-wouldnt-have-sent-troops-to-fight-nazis-and-save-jews-israel-shouldnt-exist/">pacifism of </a><a href="http://thespeechatimeforchoosing.wordpress.com/2012/01/01/ron-paul-i-wouldnt-have-sent-troops-to-fight-nazis-and-save-jews-israel-shouldnt-exist/">the Austrian School/Ron Paul variant</a> of libertarianism or the <a href="http://www.aynrand.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&id=15537&news_iv_ctrl=1223">ultra-militarism of the Ayn Rand variant</a>.This contradiction is one that runs very deep and highlights even greater issues with libertarianism. As I will show, libertarian political philosophy is a incoherent Rorschach test that can justify a vast range of policy choices and libertarianism has in general failed to come up with a justification for its core proposals.</p>

<p>As far as I can tell almost all non-anarchist libertarians accept these two principles</p>
<ol><li>The government policies that maximize liberty are the optimal ones. Illegitimate initiation of force against another is usually a violation of liberty.</li>
    <li>It is acceptable for governments to take measures intended prevent violations of liberties by third parties, including appropriate retaliatory force. This justifies the government to maintain armies, police forces and the like.</li>
</ol>
<p>When it comes to intervention to stop clear human rights violations, these two core principles of libertarian ideology are in conflict. Ayn Rand libertarianism argues that dictatorships are "initiating force" and are therefore legitimate subjects of "retaliatory force". Other variants of libertarianism  contend that the intervention itself will be the "initiation of force". Even before the Arab Spring the view of the<a href="http://www.aynrand.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&id=13659&news_iv_ctrl=1221"> Ayn Rand institute was that</a> "Iran and Syria are our enemies...The United States should be bombing, not 'engaging,' these terrorist "regimes."  On the other extreme <a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4167841,00.html">Ron Paul's opinion on war is almost complete pacifism</a>. Ron Paul “wouldn’t have risked American lives to end the Holocaust." and  "I wouldn't send US troops to fight Nazis”. A former top aide for Ron Paul said of these comments, "I don't think that's because he's an anti-Semite. It's because he’s an extreme isolationist and he’s trying to be 100% principled–he doesn't think there’s any reason to intervene for human rights or any other reason anywhere on the planet."  What both Ron Paul's and Ayn Rand's followers have in common is their libertarianism is unable to produce a viewpoint on foreign policy that is workable when applied to the real world.</p>

<p>This highlights an even greater contradiction in libertarian ideology. The theoretical justifications of libertarianism fail on their own terms, are incoherent and may not even justify a libertarian state even when they are assumed to hold true. <a href="http://ppe.sagepub.com/content/8/1/43.abstract">Karl Widerquist in a 2009 paper points out</a> that the basic principles of libertaianism, the same ones that are claimed to justify "no more than a minimal state with sharply limited powers", can actually be interpreted to justify "the acceptance of whatever state powers and property rights have been in place for a sufficient amount of time".</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<div>
        
<p>Steve Ballmer, the CEO of Microsoft for the past 13 years, <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/heres-microsoft-ceo-ballmers-goodbye-note-to-the-troops-7000019795/">has announced</a> that he will retire within the next 12 months.In<a href="http://www.zdnet.com/heres-microsoft-ceo-ballmers-goodbye-note-to-the-troops-7000019795/"> a letter</a> to Microsoft employees released this morning Ballmer stated that</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>My original thoughts on timing would have had my retirement happen in the middle of our transformation to a devices and services company focused on empowering customers in the activities they value most. We need a CEO who will be here longer term for this new direction. </em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Microsoft is certainly in need of a transition. According to Business Insider, Microsoft stock <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/ballmer-era-stock-price-2013-8">has fallen</a> over 40% during Ballmer's tenure.</p>

<p>Compare Ballmer's stock performance to that during Bill Gates' time as CEO (Ballmer started in 2000).</p>

<p>Microsoft's "transformation to a devices and services company" has consisted of a poorly executed imitation of Apple. This imitation is complete with <a href="http://www.tomsguide.com/us/xbox-one-microsoft-store-display,news-17421.html">Microsoft Stores</a> and a tablet/phone operating system <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-microsoft-ceo-steve-ballmers-failures-20130823,0,2666964.story">no one wants to use</a>.During Ballmer's term Microsoft lost the server market to GNU/Linux based operating systems and failed to put forth a marketable alternative to Android and Apple smartphones and tablets.<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/12/13/windows_market_share_just_20percent/">According to a report released by Goldman Sachs,</a> Microsoft has fallen from almost total dominance of the computer market to just over 20% market share. As the following graph from report makes clear, this change took place almost entirely during Ballmer's tenure.</p>

<p>What about product quality? Well the same tribute comedian David Letterman aired after Bill Gates' retirement could very well be used to describe Microsoft under Ballmer.</p>

<p><a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121986172394776997.html?mod=hps_us_pageone&cb=logged0.4228730972390622">After a 1989 merger the Roanoke, Va hospital market became concentrated in the hands of one company</a>, Carilion Health Systems. By the most recent accounts profits of the company reached 107 million dollars and the pay of its CEO reached $2.07 million. However, things are not going as well for Carilion's patients. Carilion's colonoscopy fees are 4 to 10 times those of nearby health-care providers and their CT scan fees are almost three times those of other providers.  After the formation of the monopoly, insurance premiums soared in Roanoke. This change was largely driven by Carilion's high fees. Before the merger premiums were 20% lower than those of nearby Richmond. Now premiums in Roanoke are the highest in Virginia.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, such monopolies are all too common in the American health care system. Hospital owners and management get rich while patients get shafted with high fees. Or in many cases bodies that control the care provided at many hospitals pull their weight to ensure that needed care is not provided at all.</p>

<p><a href="http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/suppl/2003/12/12/hlthaff.w3.472v1.DC1">A study published in the journal <em>Health Affairs </em>f</a>ound substantial market concentration in the health care market that is sufficient to allow hospitals to charge public insurance providers (such as Medicare and Medicaid) different prices than those demanded of private insurance providers and individuals. In particular, hospitals can shift costs onto private insurance providers. The evidence suggests that for-profit providers are more likely to abuse their market power then non-profit providers. This differential pricing would be unlikely to occur in a competitive market because competition, and the risk of being undercut by other hospitals, would tend to push the maximum price down to a level near the cost of production.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/08/hospital-prices-cost-differences_n_3232678.html?1367985666">A review of prices charged by hospitals in the greater New York City metropolitan area</a> found vast differences in prices charged for equivalent COPD treatments. The most expensive hospital charged $99,690. The cheapest hospital charged $7,044.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21756018">A 2011 study concluded that</a> "Hospital markets in the United States now mostly fall within the definitions adopted by the DOJ [Department of Justice] and FTC [Federal Trade Commission] as moderately to highly concentrated" and that "Hospitals in concentrated markets charge significantly higher prices and earn significantly higher margins from private insurers than do hospitals in competitive markets."</p>

<p><a href="http://ncronline.org/news/catholic-hospitals-serve-one-six-patients-united-states">One in every 6</a> hospital patients in America is served at a Catholic hospital. <a href="http://rhrealitycheck.org/article/2013/03/25/dont-take-her-to-catholic-hospital/">Almost 10%</a> of the religious hospitals in the United States are the sole provider of hospital care in their area. However, this vast patient body gives the Church substantial power to set the range of health care provided in the United States.  Many more are in highly concentrated markets and face only limited competition.  The Catholic Church requires the hospitals under its control to follow “<a title="(Open in new tab) " href="http://www.usccb.org/about/doctrine/ethical-and-religious-directives/" rel="external">Ethical and Religious Directives</a>” which often<a href="http://rhrealitycheck.org/article/2013/06/06/do-religious-restrictions-force-doctors-to-commit-malpractice/"> contradict generally accepted medical practices</a>.</p>

<p>What should be done to increase competition in the health care market? First of all increased anti-trust enforcement should be applied to the health care market and hospital chains in concentrated markets should be broken up. In areas where there is not sufficient demand for hospital services to support a competitive market a publicly owned hospital monopoly is preferable to a private one.</p>

      <title>Japan Considers Constitutional Amendments: Proposed Changes Include Military Buildup and Gutted Civil Liberties Protections</title>

        <p>Japan's prime minister Shinzo Abe <a href="http://japandailypress.com/pm-abe-says-its-his-historic-mission-to-change-japans-constitution-1333768/">has stated that he</a> "will strive toward constitutional revisions for the future” and that changing Japan's constitution, which has remained unattended since its ratification in 1947, is part of his “historic mission”. These changes have become possible as Abe's party won a sizable majority in the Diet -- the country's legislative body -- <a href="http://japandailypress.com/voter-turnout-for-japans-upper-house-elections-low-even-with-internet-campaigning-2232679/">despite low voter turnout</a>. <a href="http://japandailypress.com/pm-abe-says-he-intends-to-revise-constitution-in-bid-to-get-more-votes-for-ldp-1732466/">To obtain the needed 2/3rds of both houses of the Diet,</a> Abe will still need substantial cooperation from outside his own party. <br />
However, it appears that many of the suggested changes are very troubling. Article 9 of Japan's constitution prohibits the use of military force to solve political disputes and declares that "land, sea, and air forces, as well as other war potential, will never be maintained". While the exact wording of the proposed amendments have not yet been released it is likely that these restrictions on the military will likely be reduced. Likely changes include permitting preemptive military offensives and an expansion of Japan's Self Defense Forces. <a href="http://www.chinapost.com.tw/editorial/world-issues/2013/08/05/385502/p2/Japan's-pacifist.htm">A draft declares that</a> Japanese citizens have an obligation to “guard the sovereignty of the land, sea, and air territories of the nation” and creates a formal Japanese military force. <br />
Even more troubling are the proposed reductions to protections of civil liberties.According to a NPR report a proposed amendment <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=213578220">will place the goal protecting public order</a> at a priority superior to protecting individual rights. <a href="http://www.chinapost.com.tw/editorial/world-issues/2013/08/05/385502/Japans-pacifist.htm">The proposed amendment</a> declares that while the government should “respect the rights of the individual to the greatest extent”, but only when “maintaining public order” is not threatened. The amendment then states that "[the citizenry] must have self-consciousness regarding the responsibilities and duties that come with freedom." <br />
Another amendment, which Abe proposes to put to a vote before his other proposals, will reduce the barrier to passing constitutional amendments.  </p><p><a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/npr" class="p-category" rel="tag">#npr</a> <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/old" class="p-category" rel="tag">#old</a> <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/old" class="p-category" rel="tag">#old</a> <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/shinzoabe" class="p-category" rel="tag">#shinzoabe</a> <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/uncategorized" class="p-category" rel="tag">#uncategorized</a></p></div>]]></description>

<p>What a shame.

<p>Ever feel like the Republicans are just the party of no, just trying to block all productive work until they get back into the White House? Turns out you are not alone. Conservative talk show host Laura Ingraham told Republicans on her show yesterday that “Your job as an opposition party is to stand against what</p>
