<p>On Facebook and twitter I've seen a number of people posting about how the recent terrorist attacks in Nigeria by Boko Haram among other groups have not received as much coverage as the French terrorist attack. These posters point out that the Nigerian attacks claimed many more lives than the French terrorists. However that is the same reason that the Nigerian attacks are not getting covered. Media prefers to give coverage to rare that destructive events, and does not like to give coverage to more common events even if the more common events in combined are much more destructive. This is a persistent media bias that occurs across multiple different fields.<img align="left" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2015/01/011515_0603_Rareeventsg1.jpg.html" alt=""><span style="color:#44546a; font-size:9pt"><em>British anti-terrorism poster via <a href="https://flic.kr/p/5hm7vX"></a><a href="https://flic.kr/p/5hm7vX">https:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>flic.kr/<wbr></wbr>p/<wbr></wbr>5hm7vX</a><br /></em></span></p>

<p> It seen in discussions of energy policy, gun policy, climate change, transportation policy, tech policy and many other different fields. It's the reason why you're much more likely to have heard the likes of Fukushima or Chernobyl then the many smaller accidents and disasters of occurred with conventional energy sources. It's why in discussions of gun policy relatively rare mass shootings have received much more attention in a much more frequent regular shootings and gang violence. It's why something like the disappearing Malaysian planes ever see much more coverage than the frequent car wrecks the claim tens of thousands of lives. Many commentators have tried to frame the lack of coverage in Nigeria is a side effect of racism. However treating it as a symptom of media bias towards large and rare events is much more likely. The Nigerian conflict claimed almost 4000 lives in just 2014 alone. And this conflict occurred in one of the most war prone areas in the world, a part of the world where some of the most destructive conflicts ever have occurred. Unfortunately, what happened in Nigeria is a very common event. For after a kidnapping in the Nigerian school girls this conflict received a lot of coverage, the media simply got tired of the subject because the destruction is so ubiquitous, the press moved on to a juicier subject.  The possibility of racism is a main driver of the lack of coverage given to Nigeria can be eliminated simply due to the fact that ignoring large events is so common among the press. This can also be eliminated to the wide range of politicians and officials who expressed concern about the conflict in Nigeria. Here are just a few examples of the press giving more time to a major but rare event into much more common related event.</p>
<ul><li>An obvious example of this is the recent Malaysian plane crash. Plane crashes are exceedingly rare, much rarer than car crashes. However, the Malaysian plane crashes received 24-7 coverage from number of media outlets. The reason for this is pretty much that plane crashes are something that people perceive as high risk but which are in reality a very infrequent low risk thing. Air travel is on the safest forms of mass transportation and transportation in general. When you divide the number of fatalities by the number of passenger miles traveled you obtain a result of dispels the commonly held perception that flying is dangerous. <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/space/how-risky-is-flying.html">One report determined</a> that the risk of being killed in a plane crash for the typical American is about one and 11 million per year, however the equivalent risk of dying in a car accident is about one in 5000. When varying number of passenger miles traveled is taken into account, comes out to be that air travel is about as safe as driving a car or riding a train. The number of deaths per mile traveled turns out to be about the same for each mode of transit. Car crashes and railway accidents account for about 1.3 deaths per hundred million vehicle miles. Motorcycles count for about 31.3 deaths per hundred vehicle miles traveled, making it one most dangerous forms of transit widely used. And when plane crashes do happen they are single events that cause a lot of damage at once. A rare event that causes a lot of damage? That something journalists will want to cover.
</li><li>Another good example of this can be found in the energy industry. Nuclear energy is one of the safest forms of energy <a href="http://nextbigfuture.com/2011/03/deaths-per-twh-by-energy-source.html">and when you divide the amount of fatalities caused by nuclear accidents by the amount of energy produced in reactors</a>, the number is very low compared to many other major sources of energy. Fossil fuels and biomass energy are among the top most lethal energy sources and nabbed in Trieste relaxants there much more frequent than nuclear energy's accidents, and which are in aggregate much more destructive. You could probably name and number of well-known nuclear accidents. Chernobyl. Fukushima. Three Mile Island. These types of rare but high destruction at once events get a lot of media coverage. The public's view of the frequency of these accidents is highly distorted. Nuclear is perceived as one of the more dangerous energy sources around, when in fact it is one of the safer ones. Coal is by far the most dangerous energy source, air pollution produced and industrial accidents caused are factored into the death toll. Depending on the type of coal and how it is used, coal causes between 60 and 170 deaths per terawatt hour. Oil is second on the death count, coming in at about 32 deaths per terawatt hour equivalent. Biofuels are the next on the list causing about 12 deaths per terawatt hour equivalent generated (this does not include the fairly high death count caused by competition with the food supply for fuel feedstock, the excess deaths due to this are counted biofuels have a death toll that exceeds coal). Nuclear's fatalities are very low at about 0.04 deaths per terawatt hour.
</li><li>You can think of many other examples of this phenomenon happening in the media. I could for example mention the excess attention in the media given to mass shootings over regular crime. Or for that manner the excess attention given to terrorism in general compared to the many other threats facing the world. Or the wide distortion of perceptions of disease threats. People were treating the Ebola crisis as if it were a science fiction disaster movie coming to life. I can mention the relatively low priority given to the many mundane diseases around. Humans are terrible at perceiving risk, media coverage is no exception.</li></ul><p><a href="../../tag/denialismantiscience.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#denialismantiscience</a> <a href="../../tag/france.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#france</a> <a href="../../tag/nigeria.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#nigeria</a> <a href="../../tag/threemileisland.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#threemileisland</a></p></div>                    </div>

<p><i><a href="https://theojones.name/blog-post-series-on-the-history-of-sustainable-energy-and-climate-change-politics/">This is part of a blog post series on climate change.</a></i>In this post I am using a new way of doing citations that I will use in some of my longer posts. The citations can be found at the end notes/</p>

<p>The opposition to the development of nuclear energy was probably one of the worst mistakes the movement has ever made. A rapid conversion to nuclear energy in the 1970s – like the one France did – would have vastly reduced greenhouse gas emissions. France’s per capita greenhouse gas emissions (mostly due to cars, and heating fuel) is substantially less than the EU average, and a little over a third of the GHG emissions of the United States.

<p>sources have higher environmental impact than nuclear due to the large levels of natural resources needed to make wind and solar collectors, and due to the land-use of renewable sources. Nuclear is at cost parity with fossil fuels (even unsubsidized), while renewable still cost substantially more than traditional sources. The environmental opposition to nuclear energy has largely come out of two places. 1) the opposition to nuclear weapons (note the ”peace” in ”Greenpeace”), 2) a general technophobia. I will discuss both of these trends in this section. The relation between opposition to nuclear weapons, and the opposition to nuclear energy certainly exists for Greenpeace. The group was founded in part to oppose a nuclear weapons test on the Alaskan island of Amchitka. There were some concerns that this test could trigger geologic events like earthquakes or tsunamis. Greenpeace eventually formed out a group of (mostly Quaker) protesters opposing this event. Some of their tactics were opposed by established environmental groups – like the Sierra Club. Greenpeace’s website declares that <i>”motivated by their vision of a green and peaceful world, a small team of activists set sail from Vancouver, Canada in an old fishing boat. These activists, the founders of Greenpeace, believed a few individuals could make a difference... Amchitka was the last refuge for 3,000 endangered sea otters, and home to bald eagles, peregrine falcons, and other wildlife.”</i>[2].After this fissure with the environmental movement they eventually formed their own organization. Even today Greenpeace’s states that their mission includes the following goal ”<i>Working for disarmament and peace by reducing dependence on finite resources and calling for the elimination of all nuclear weapons.</i>” [3]. The group has even recently been involved in anti-war protests. In June of 2014 the group conducted a protest against NSA surveillance, and the construction of a new NSA data center [4]. Greenpeace is opposed to civilian nuclear energy and considers nuclear energy as a potential source of nuclear proflarition. They argue that the ability of nuclear energy to mitigate climate change is minor. They argue that the energy source has a high risk of accident, argue that nuclear energy has strong environmental impacts, and that nuclear energy is plagued by slow construction times, and dramatic cost overruns. They also argue that it competes with renewable energy for funding. I will discuss the ability for nuclear energy to mitigate climate change elsewhere, – in short it is very large. In fact it is possible to create a climate mitigation strategy that largely reilyes on nuclear energy. The construction times of nuclear energy are not a product of the technology but instead a product of the regulatory environment and finance. Nuclear energy construction times in France during the 1970s were around two years – similar to the construction times of renewable energy projects. Construction times in the U.S in the 50s and 60s were also around two years. There have been no major accidents at any of these projects. A major difference between these projects and modern ones is that these rapidly completed projects were generally publicly owned. Public or quasi-public ownership may be the preferable way to manage energy projects. With nuclear energy there is a general conflict of interest with the profit role and the public safety role. This produces a risk of an extrenality cost, and this is only mitigated by a expensive regulatory process. Public ownership avoids this conflict of interest. I would also argue that similar conflicts of interest have the potential to occur with renewable energy. There will be a large number of subsidies and government funding available to privately owned renewable energy firms, and it will be a tough regulatory challenge to provide that these funds are well-used. Later, I will discuss a proposal for quasi-public ownership of energy infrastructure that still allows for reasonable market pressure. In reality the opposition to nuclear energy has been one of the largest delays in the mitigation of climate change.</p>

<p>To the credit of Greenpeace, they have been one of the most vocal proponents of action on climate change. They call climate change ”the number one threat facing our planet”. They argue for a rapid mitigation of the threat. In their plan developed nation emissions would be reduced by 40 percent by 2020 and global emissions would be reduced to near zero. The group has also been a major contributor to activism on other environmental issues.<br />There is another source of opposition to nuclear energy. A general opposi tion of projects perceived to be non-”natural” over projects perceived to have a ”natural” basis. Even when the more ”natural” project is worse for the environment. This comes with a general embrace of pseudoscience within the more hardline elements environmental community, and a general opposition to technology. A lot of this conception of ”naturalness” comes from a vague perception of semi-vitalism – a belief that living/”natural” things have some property beyond their mere chemical composition. There is no scientific evidence for such a claim, but it is common/implied in arguments for ”alternative” (read: useless) medicine, organic foods (the certification for these foods is a mix of things that do some good, and things that are net harmful), opposition to the use of pesticides (which often net help the environment by reducing land use) and other issues. This perception, I believe, is at the core of a lot of the opposition to technological innovations among environmental groups. This is the most clear in the arguments against GMO crops.<br />The claims made by the campaigners against genetically modified foods are simply absurd. This ideology’s claims about the health effects of GMOs are as discredited in the scientific community as creationism or global warming denialism and all major scientific associations of repute that have looked into the issue disavow it. Their position that a compound can suddenly become toxic when synthesized due to a genetic modification of a plant, but is not toxic when synthesized by a natural process violates the laws of physics, chemistry and biology (It is worth noting that the BT toxin – a common product of genetic modification – is also a commonly used pest control in organic food, due to the fact that it is produced in the bacterium <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i>) Their understanding of the economics of these products is not much better. These compounds have passed the approval of the FDA and the EPA. our food is not being poisoned by Monsanto (or the Illuminati, or whoever else the people at Natural News are blaming today). While Monsanto and its ilk have business practices that are very good, the same can be said of major players in almost every industry in the world. In my opinion this ”movement” is just dressed-up ludditeism – both in the modern sense of general technophobia, and in the sense of the historical Luddite movement’s belief that the abuses of sweatshops were an inevitable outcome of the automation of textile production.<br />Technophobia is a core undercurrent of the anti-GMO ideology. When you read their discussions about ”frankenfoods” (of course ignoring the fact that almost all domesticated plants and animals differ greatly from their wild relatives) they are employing the idea that new technology is inherently bad and dangerous, while the ”natural” is inherently good and safe. Nothing of the kind is true. Technology has a great ability to improve our standard of living and there are many things that ”natural” Of course there are also harmful synthetic products.I put the word ”natural” in quotes because man-made things and ”natural” products are created by the same laws of physics. In reality,<br />everything in this universe is natural. To the anti-GMO activist, ”natural” just means created with recently invented technology and this technology is scary.<br />Like the historical Luddites who blamed technology for the ills of the textile industry, when these issues were really created by unethical business practices,anti-GMO activists claim that the bad behavior of business is the unavoidable result of technology. These activists (rightly) criticize the patent litigation of Monsanto. However, instead of seeing this as another symptom of a broken patent system, they inexplicably blame the technology. These activists (rightly) see a greedy monopolist in Monsanto but they blame the technology instead of calling for anti-trust reform. This attitude will only serve to hold back the progress made possible by technology, without dealing with the systemic issues that allowed these unethicalbusiness practices. Rest assured that even without GMO foods, these economic issues will continue to wreak havoc in other sectors of the economy.A common third way approach to the GMO issue is labling. Now I will discuss why GMO labeling is a terrible idea. There is no scientific basis to fear GMO products.The claimed consumer choice benefits of mandatory labeling can be fulfilled by private certifications and currently existing, government ran certification programs.Due to the dynamics of food markets, mandatory GMO labeling amounts to a defacto GMO ban. This will increase food prices and possibly add to the environmental damage cause by agriculture.The World Health Organization notes ”GM foods currently available on the international market have passed risk assessments and are not likely to present risks for human health”.The American Association for the Advancement of Science concluded that ”Several current efforts to require labeling of GM foods are not being driven by any credible scientific evidence that these foods are dangerous” and that ”GM crops are the most extensively tested crops ever”.Their report also noted that labeling could mislead and falsely alarm consumers.<br />All of the claimed consumer choice benefits of GMO labeling can be done by voluntary certification. All products currently sold as organic in the U.S lack GMO products. Private certifications are also very good at assuring that products are prepared in accordance to standards that are sufficient for their consumers. Note that there are many private companies which certify kosher products. Economies of scale in food production make it inefficient and cost prohibitive for companies to create separate product lines with GMO and non-GMO foods. Therefore, just one of these options will be taken.If the labeling causes a substantial minority of the population to avoid GMO foods then these foods will be forced off the market for everyone. This has already happened in Europe, where GMO labeling is mandatory. In fact, the push for labeling by the anti-GMO movement is just a pretext to regulate these products out of existence.This will harm consumers and the environment because GMO products require less land usage than their competitors. The price of this extra land will be passed on to consumers, along with the price of increased crop loss. This increased land usage will also have substantial environmental impacts. However, there will be no clear economic benefits to this defacto ban on GMO foods.</p>

<p>It is clear that there is much that we can do to improve the energy efficiency of our economy. However, the main reason why these options are not deployed is consumers are unable to price and evaluate the future energy consumption of the products that they buy. Here I will propose a method of pre-funding energy consumption of consumer products. Under my proposal manufacturers of consumer, business and industrial electronics and appliances would be required to make an energy deposit based on the future energy consumption of their products. This deposit will be equal to the cost of the energy that the typical user of the product would pay over a typical product lifetime. The consumer could then redeem this energy deposit when they buy electricity or fuel.This proposal would provide consumers a clear signal of the value of the future energy consumption of their purchases. This is because the energy consumption would be part of the cost of purchase. The effect of this proposal on the pocketbooks of consumers would be minimal because the cost of the energy deposit would be rebated dollar for dollar to the consumer's future energy consumption.If consumers buy more efficient products as a result of this program then they will on the whole save money.Unlike alternatives, my proposal is a market-based way of encouraging energy efficiency. It works by making markets more efficient instead of telling consumers what they can buy. As far as I can tell no one has proposed this idea before. This blog post gives an overview of the justifications for this program. In later posts I will go deeper into these issues and provide more details on how pre-funding energy consumption would work.</p>

<p>The potential scale of energy efficiency improvements that can be made in the United States is vast. The United States is much less efficient in its energy usage than other industrialized nations. <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EG.USE.PCAP.KG.OE">According to the World Bank,</a> the average American uses about 300.91 GJ (83586 KWH) of energy per year. For comparison, the average resident of France uses a little over half that or 169.28 GJ per year.The following map depicts the differences of energy consumption between different countries.</p>

<p>It is possible that America could attain this type of energy efficiency in two decades.</p>

<p>Why haven't we achieved a more efficient economy already? One important reason is that consumers have imperfect information about energy usage.When buying a product consumers often have little knowledge about which is more energy efficient. Even when the energy usage of a product is labeled, it is difficult for a typical person to quantify this into a long term cost of ownership. How many consumers check how much money a 60 watt light-bulb will cost to run? How many even know how to conduct these calculations? Most likely very few. To run efficiently markets require consumers to have good information on what they are purchasing and how the product compares to alternatives. My proposal will solve this issue. The future cost of energy will be made immediately known to the consumer because it will show up on the price tag.The guesswork that consumers have to do to compare energy efficiency will be eliminated. A strong source of bias and inefficiency in the marketplace will be fixed.</p>

<p>My proposal is different than others which have been previously made as it relies on giving consumers and businesses a market signal without supporting particular options on the market. Consumers are allowed to apply other information they have and their knowledge of their exact circumstances to their product decisions. While the government should certainly use multiple methods to encourage energy efficiency my proposal may be best suited to form the core of an energy efficiency policy because of its market-based nature. Regulations that ban certain products act by taking choose away from consumers. When the government subsides a type of product it may be picking favorites, even when an even more cost effective energy efficiency option may be available.</p>
