<p>There is a initiative petition in Arizona to legalize marijuana.Its full text can be found on the website of Safer Arizona, the group organizing the initiative. <a href="http://legalizeaz.com/"></a><a href="http://legalizeaz.com/">http:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>legalizeaz.com/<wbr></wbr></a> has a list of locations where signatures are being collected. I have already had the opportunity to sign it</p>

<p><a href="http://www.azcentral.com/news/politics/articles/20130612personal-experience-spurs-effort-legalize-pot-recreational-use.html">From an article in the <em>Arizona Republic</em> on the the initiative.</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dennis Bohlke, the 59-year-old computer programmer who is leading the effort, said the Safer Arizona initiative is modeled after Colorado’s newly enacted law, which taxes and regulates marijuana.</p>

<p>“The intent of the initiative is to legalize marijuana in Arizona and to treat it as we treat alcohol,” said Bohlke.</p>

<p>The effort would amend the state Constitution to allow people 18 and older “to consume or possess limited amounts” of marijuana. The initiative would allow state officials to license grow facilities, marijuana stores and other facilities.</p>

<p>The initiative needs 259,213 valid signatures by July 3, 2014, to qualify for the November 2014 ballot.</p>

<p>It is clear that there is much that we can do to improve the energy efficiency of our economy. However, the main reason why these options are not deployed is consumers are unable to price and evaluate the future energy consumption of the products that they buy. Here I will propose a method of pre-funding energy consumption of consumer products. Under my proposal manufacturers of consumer, business and industrial electronics and appliances would be required to make an energy deposit based on the future energy consumption of their products. This deposit will be equal to the cost of the energy that the typical user of the product would pay over a typical product lifetime. The consumer could then redeem this energy deposit when they buy electricity or fuel.This proposal would provide consumers a clear signal of the value of the future energy consumption of their purchases. This is because the energy consumption would be part of the cost of purchase. The effect of this proposal on the pocketbooks of consumers would be minimal because the cost of the energy deposit would be rebated dollar for dollar to the consumer's future energy consumption.If consumers buy more efficient products as a result of this program then they will on the whole save money.Unlike alternatives, my proposal is a market-based way of encouraging energy efficiency. It works by making markets more efficient instead of telling consumers what they can buy. As far as I can tell no one has proposed this idea before. This blog post gives an overview of the justifications for this program. In later posts I will go deeper into these issues and provide more details on how pre-funding energy consumption would work.</p>

<p>The potential scale of energy efficiency improvements that can be made in the United States is vast. The United States is much less efficient in its energy usage than other industrialized nations. <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EG.USE.PCAP.KG.OE">According to the World Bank,</a> the average American uses about 300.91 GJ (83586 KWH) of energy per year. For comparison, the average resident of France uses a little over half that or 169.28 GJ per year.The following map depicts the differences of energy consumption between different countries.</p>

<p>[caption id="attachment_490" align="alignnone" width="530"]<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Energy-consumption-per-capita-2003.png"></a> Map Via Wikipedia and licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported license.[/caption]</p>

<p>It is possible that America could attain this type of energy efficiency in two decades.</p>

<p>Why haven't we achieved a more efficient economy already? One important reason is that consumers have imperfect information about energy usage.When buying a product consumers often have little knowledge about which is more energy efficient. Even when the energy usage of a product is labeled, it is difficult for a typical person to quantify this into a long term cost of ownership. How many consumers check how much money a 60 watt light-bulb will cost to run? How many even know how to conduct these calculations? Most likely very few. To run efficiently markets require consumers to have good information on what they are purchasing and how the product compares to alternatives. My proposal will solve this issue. The future cost of energy will be made immediately known to the consumer because it will show up on the price tag.The guesswork that consumers have to do to compare energy efficiency will be eliminated. A strong source of bias and inefficiency in the marketplace will be fixed.</p>

<p>My proposal is different than others which have been previously made as it relies on giving consumers and businesses a market signal without supporting particular options on the market. Consumers are allowed to apply other information they have and their knowledge of their exact circumstances to their product decisions. While the government should certainly use multiple methods to encourage energy efficiency my proposal may be best suited to form the core of an energy efficiency policy because of its market-based nature. Regulations that ban certain products act by taking choose away from consumers. When the government subsides a type of product it may be picking favorites, even when an even more cost effective energy efficiency option may be available.</p>

<p>I've been trying various methods to make this blog load faster and optimize WordPress. This post discusses some of what I found works and what I found didn't work.  <br />One of the first things I tried was W3 Total Cache which many bloggers . This plugin was able to reduce my page load times by about 1 sec, but I decided that it is more trouble than it is worth. It was incompatible with other plugins that I have been using, created issues with page loading and created other issues. If you do decide to use this plugin I recommend that you do not use the minify options as this functionality was in my experience the most likely to cause problems. Also, install the APC module for PHP (on Ubuntu apt-get install php-apc). APC makes the caching run more efficiently.The next thing I did was to reduce the "above the fold content" on my posts and put more of my post content below the read more button. This resulted in a home page that loaded faster. Previously I had the full content of my posts load on the front page, now I limit the part of my posts that show on the front page to the first paragraph.  <br /><!--more--></p>
<p>I then tried other plugins to make my WordPress faster.The WP-SmushIt is one that I recommend. It reduces the file size of the images that get sent to the readers' browsers. I also recommend Combine JS and Combine CSS which merge the Javascript and CSS files on your website. <br />
The next thing I did was minimize the external content that loads on this website.Each time you load a widget or image from an outside website you require the reader's browser to make a DNS request. I replaced the twitter widget with a link to my twitter. I also replaced embedded images that load from external websites with locally hosted images.</p><p><a href="../../tag/apc.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#apc</a> <a href="../../tag/css.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#css</a> <a href="../../tag/dns.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#dns</a> <a href="../../tag/old.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#old</a> <a href="../../tag/old.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#old</a> <a href="../../tag/uncategorized.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#uncategorized</a> <a href="../../tag/w3totalcache.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#w3totalcache</a></p></div>                    </div>

<p><!--StartFragment--><a href="http://www.countthecosts.org/seven-costs/wasting-billions-drug-law-enforcement#%281%29">Current drug laws cost the global economy at least 100 billion dollars per year.</a> Imagine what we could do with that money if it were instead spent on something like healthcare, education, reducing non-drug crimes or alleviating poverty. Instead of spending this money on something that is useful to the nation we chose to spend it on an ineffective policy that increases crime and jams our courts and spreads disease. There is an alternative</p>

<p>[caption id="attachment_454" align="alignright" width="300"] A view of a neon sign of a cannabis coffee shop in Arnhem, The Netherlands .Image via Wikipedia and licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported license[/caption]</p>

<p>to this policy. I advocate the legalization of mild drugs such as marijuana and the decriminalization of hard drugs. This policy will treat marijuana like alcohol and tobacco and will treat the hard drugs such as cocaine as a public health issue instead of a criminal problem. If we decriminalize drug use the government will not continue to try to tell millions of people throughout this country what chemicals they can or can not voluntarily put into their bodies. Decriminalizing drugs will reduce non drug crimes and will free up law enforcement resources to prosecute other more important crimes. Legalizing drugs is a good policy.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Despite all of the money that we spend on keeping drugs illegal this policy is not working. Millions throughout this country still use illegal drugs.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult_lifetime_cannabis_use_by_country"> Over 100 million Americans over the age of 12 have used marijuana at least once during their lives.</a> According a survey by the<a href="http://oas.samhsa.gov/NSDUH/2k10NSDUH/2k10Results.htm"> Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 7.8% of high school seniors surveyed said that they have used cocaine,</a> 16.8% have used amphetamines (speed) , 12% have used hallucinogenic drugs and 47.8 have used marijuana. Is this what we are paying tens of billions of dollars for? Why as a country are we paying billions of dollars to enforce laws that tens of millions people regularly violate? What does trying to enforce an unenforceable law do to the public’s respect of our government and the laws it makes?</p>

<p>I believe that we should adopt the marijuana policy that the Netherlands currently uses. In the Netherlands highly regulated “coffee shops” can sell marijuana to adults. Unlike drug dealers in the U.S “coffee shop” owners in the Netherlands are subject to strict regulation over the quality and safety of their products. A “coffee shop” is prevented from advertising , selling hard drugs or alcohol , selling more than five grams of marijuana during any single transaction or operating within 250 meters of a school.</p>

<p>If our government adopted the same policy as Netherlands of allowing highly regulated stores to legally sell marijuana it would take the crime and violence out of the trade of this drug. Doing this would make it harder for minors to obtain marijuana because the legal stores would have no incentive to risk getting shut down by breaking the law by selling to minors. Legalizing marijuana would also generate tax revenue because unlike the drug dealers the legal sellers of marijuana would pay sales and excise taxes.</p>

<p>I would recommend I policy of drug decriminalization to deal with the “hard” drugs such as cocaine. This policy would be along the lines of the one that currently exists for heroin addicts in Switzerland. Swiss heroin addicts can go to one of 22 government operated clinics to receive a safe,clean and free shot of heroin. While they are at the clinic the addicts will be informed about treatment they can receive to end their addiction. Social workers at the clinics will encourage addicts to seek rehab. The clinics are the only entity that may legally distribute the drugs. Possession of drugs is not prosecuted but drug dealers are. If the U.S adopted this system the illegal drug dealers would soon be out of business as there is no way that they can compete with the clinics that distribute the drugs for free. There will no longer be drug dealers shooting each other in the streets. The drugs distributed by the clinic will be at a constant and safe dosage so there will be a much lower risk of addicts dieing of drug overdose. The drugs will be administered through safe needles, so diseases will no longer be spread through unsafe injections . There will no longer be any more drug dealers to encourage children to take up drugs . The only legal distributor of drugs will be encouraging its clients to kick their drug habit instead of trying to find new clients.</p>

<p>Drug use in the U.S causes many public health issues. These issues can be resolved by drug use decriminalization. In 2001 Portugal decriminalized drug use. <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=portugal-drug-decriminalization">According to an article published in Scientific American the number of new cases of HIV caused by unsafe injections of drugs went from almost 1400 in 2001 to 400 in 2006</a>. Imagine how many lives could be saved if a policy of drug decriminalization was adopted in the U.S and that policy had a similar effect. According to a 2002 fact sheet published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a Federal Government agency unsafe injections of illegal drugs account for over one third of all cases of HIV. An estimated 11,635 people per year in the United States get HIV through unsafe injections of illegal drugs. Other countries that have taken the path of drug decriminalization have had similar reductions in HIV rates. According to the World Health Organization the percentage of users of injected drugs that have HIV declined from 5% in 1991 to 1% in 2006 . It is clear that our current drug policy is a public health disaster and that it will make for a healthier population if we decriminalize drugs</p>

<p>We have already done something similar to our current drug policy. In 1920 the 18th amendment to the constitution was ratified. Section one of it read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After one year from the ratification of this article the manufacture, sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors within, the importation thereof into, or the exportation thereof from the United States and all territory subject to the jurisdiction thereof for beverage purposes is hereby prohibited.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ratification of the 18th amendment brought prohibition into existence. Prohibition turned out in a similar way to our current drug policy. Millions of people throughout the country illegally consumed alcoholic beverages. The prohibition policy increased crime because the mafia became involved in the illegal distribution of alcoholic beverages. Just as thousands of people today are getting sick from unsafe injections of illegal drugs thousands died during prohibition because the illegal producers of alcoholic beverages would mix industrial (denatured) alcohol with their brews to create a stronger beverage. industrial alcohol sometimes contains the toxic methyl alcohol and this ended up killing people. When prohibition was replied legal breweries replaced the illegal ones, safe regulated producers of alcoholic beverages replaced the mafia and a law that millions violated went away .</p>

<p>To those who think that drugs are dangerous because they cause violent crimes I have a response. Much of the crime involved with drugs is because of our current drug policy. Drug dealers shoot each other on the streets over turf to sell their products. Terrorist organizations are funded by the illegal drug trade. A study published by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime found that the Taliban received between 50 to 70 million dollars in revenue through the opium trade. These problems would go away after regulated, legal producers of drugs out competed the drug smugglers.</p>

<p>There is also a moral issue involved here. Why should the government prevent someone from putting a chemical into his or her body if that person willingly does so with full knowledge of the damage possible. This is what the government is doing with it's current drug policies. A person that takes drugs is not harming anyone else. If a addict happens to commit another crime while on drugs then that is a separate issue and that person should be prosecuted for the non-drug crime. However, prosecuting someone because they just put a certain chemical into their bodies takes away part of their right to privacy and their right to control what happens to their own body.</p>

<p>Legalizing drugs will benefit public health, reduce violence and eliminate a law that millions violate each day. We are repeating what happened with Prohibition but just with another substance. Repealing our drug laws will remove a funding source from criminal organizations and will stop drug violence. Replacing our drug laws will reduce infections from unsafe injections and will replace the unregulated drug dealers with a system of regulated manufacturers. It is past time to repeal our drug laws and replace them with something more reasonable.   <!--EndFragment--></p>

            </h2>
                    <p class="reading">
                <span class="vague">3 min read </span>
            </p>
            
<p>I have recently moved the VPS that this blog is hosted on to a Virtualmin install on Ubuntu 12.04. This tutorial shows how I have configured it. Virtualmin is a free program that can install and manage common server services. Among other things it can manage email (defaulting to the</p>

<p>postfix/dovecot servers), web (defaulting to Apache), and mailing lists (using <a class="zem_slink" title="GNU Mailman" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/" target="_blank" rel="homepage">GNU Mailman</a>). For this tutorial I will assume you have a working Ubuntu 12.04 install. I am using the free/open source GPL licensed version of Virtualmin instead of the proprietary version.</p>
<!--more--><h3>Install Virtualmin and Dependencies</h3>
<p>Virtualmin's developers have produced a script that installs Virtualmin and all of its dependencies. Download the install script with the following command.</p>

<p><em>wget <a href="http://software.virtualmin.com/gpl/scripts/install.sh"></a><a href="http://software.virtualmin.com/gpl/scripts/install.sh">http:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>software.virtualmin.com/<wbr></wbr>gpl/<wbr></wbr>scripts/<wbr></wbr>install.sh</a></em></p>

<p>Run the script to install Virtualmin and its dependencies.</p>

<p><em>/bin/sh install.sh</em></p>

<p>Wait while Virtualmin updates and installs.</p>
<h3>Create a Swap File</h3>
<p>Some of the components of the Virtualmin system can cause peaks of memory usage that can overfill the system ram on some low memory installations.The spam and virus checking programs (Spamassin and ClamAV) used by Virtualmin are particularly likely to cause peaks of RAM usage. For this reason, it is a good idea to create a swap file if you haven't created a swap partition during your install of Ubuntu.Most images distributed by VPS hosts do not include swap space. Run the following commands to create a 1GB swap file.</p>

<p><em>fallocate -l 1000M /swapfile</em></p>

<p><em>chmod 600 /swapfile</em></p>

<p><em>mkswap /swapfile</em></p>

<p>Set the swap file to load on boot by adding a line to /etc/fstab</p>

<p><em>Nano /etc/fstab</em></p>

<p>add</p>

<p><em>/swapfile none swap defaults 0 0</em></p>
<h3>Common PHP Extensions</h3>
<p>Curl and PHP5-gd are common PHP extensions that many PHP applications require. Install them with the following commands.<br /><em>apt-get clean && apt-get update && apt-get install php5-curl</em></p>

<p><em>apt-get install php5-gd</em></p>
<h3>Configure Virtualmin</h3>
<p>Now we have a Virtualmin install with all dependencies. Now it is time to configure Virtualmin.</p>

<p>Go to https://<your ip here>:10000/ and run through the Virtualmin configuration wizard.<br /><br />In my experience, the default PHP upload file size limit is too low for many applications. Change the upload settings with the following procedure. Under Services find "PHP 5 Configuration". Then click "Resource Limits".Edit the "Maximum file upload size" textbox. Save your changes.<br /><br /><a class="zem_slink" title="Greylisting" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greylisting" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">Greylisting</a> is a powerful anti-spam technique that exploits the fact that spammers rarely use standards compliant email servers.The standards for the email protocol allow the receiving server to declare that it is temporarily unavailable instead of outright accepting or rejecting a message. If this happens a standards compliant server will wait and then resend the message.Most spambots will not. Greylisting configures the mail server to declare that it is temporarily unavailable the first time that a server that has never delivered an email to you attempts to send an email. Greylisting may delay some of your email but it is one of the most effective anti-spam methods. To enable it follow the following steps.<br />Under "Email Messages" find "Email Greylisting".Click "Install Greylisting". Under "Email Messages" find "Email Greylisting". Click "Enable Greylisting".<br /><br />DKIM is another anti-spam technique that attempts to filter out spoofed email headers. To enable it follow the following steps. Under "Email Messages" find "DomainKeys Identified Mail". Click "install DKIM".<br /><br /><h3>Add Domain Name</h3><br /><br />You now have a fully configured Virtualmin installation. To add a domain name to it follow the following steps  Click "Create Virtual Server".

            <p><a href="http://www.mailpile.is/">Mailpile</a> is one of the most interesting free software/open source projects I've seen lately.It is a webmail program that is focused on security and making encryption easy to use while replicating the full feature set of a hosted email system like Gmail. The project is in an early stage of development and is not very usable yet, so it will be interesting to see how close it comes to meeting its goals. Mailpile has raised almost $150,000 in a croudfunding campaign, so it has a good chance of succeeding.</p><!--more--><p>My personal email account is self hosted and there are real benefits to hosting your own email, including resistance to mass surveillance programs and self hosted email is free of the advertising that comes with services like Gmail. However, the current free webmail programs are lackluster. Roundcube and Squirrelmail are the two big programs in this market. <a href="http://squirrelmail.org/">Squirrelmail</a> looks like something from the 90s. <a href="http://roundcube.net/">Roundcube</a> is better but still can't match the feature set of Gmail.</p><p>Mailpile will be able to run as both a web app on a remote server or as an application on the user's computer and if it is able to ship all planned features it will be superior to Roundcube and Squirrelmail. Its planned encryption features are also very interesting. Email is not very secure without encryption. It is <a href="http://www.anonymailer.net/">ea</a><a href="http://www.anonymailer.net/">sy to spoof </a>senders of email and spoofed emails <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1847402/how-to-verify-email-sender-address-is-not-spoofed">are very hard to detect</a> because the email protocol contains no way to authenticate senders.Emails are delivered and stored in plaintext and are therefore vulnerable to interception. PGP email encryption can solve these issues but encryption is difficult with most email clients. If programs like Mailpile are able to get more people to actually use email encryption then it will be a big plus.</p><p><a href="../../tag/old.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#old</a> <a href="../../tag/old.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#old</a> <a href="../../tag/pgp.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#pgp</a> <a href="../../tag/uncategorized.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#uncategorized</a></p></div>                    </div>

<p>An HIV vaccine developed in Canada <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130905155703/%3Ca%20href=" http:>http:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>communications.uwo.ca:80/<wbr></wbr>media/<wbr></wbr>releases/<wbr></wbr>2013/<wbr></wbr>September/<wbr></wbr>no_adverse_effects_in_volunteers_following_phase_i_clinical_trial_of_sumagen_aids_vaccine.html</a>"&gt;has passed a phase 1 clinical trial according to a press release by Western University, which conducted the research in collaboration with Sumagen. This clinical trial shows that the vaccine is safe to administer to humans and according to the press release "No serious adverse event was observed in any volunteer throughout the observation periods". A phase 1 trial</p>

<p>provides little information on the effectiveness of the vaccine and is only designed to detect severe side effects or safety issues. <!--more-->The vaccine is a genetically modified killed whole virus vaccine, which means that it relies on a modified version of the HIV virus which is more capable of triggering an immune response that results in immunity than an unmodified virus. The researchers report finding increased antibody production, providing some evidence that the vaccine is indeed effective. As stated in the press release</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The antibody against p24 capsid antigen increased as much as 64-fold in some vaccinees and antibody against gp120 surface antigen increased up to eight-fold after vaccination.</p>

<p>....</p>

<p>In particular, the antibody against gp120 surface antigen is considered to be very important, since some of these antibodies may represent the broadly neutralizing antibodies, which seem to be the most important parameter of an effective HIV vaccine for prevention of HIV-infection.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The researchers plan future trials to confirm that the vaccine is effective.</p>

<p>An effective vaccine would give public health officials a way to control the spread of AIDS.</p>

<p>It turns out that, despite their talk of liberty, libertarians have an awfully strong tendency to support dictators. Here are five examples of prominent libertarians shilling for, or supporting, authoritarian regimes.</p>
<ol style="font-size: medium;"><li><a style="font-size: medium;" href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2009/11/jeer-heer-has-a-ludwig-von-mises-quote.html">Lets start with what Ludwig von Mises had to say about Mussolini in his 1929 book <em>Liberalism</em></a>. "<em style="font-size: medium;">It cannot be denied that Fascism and similar movements aiming at the establishment of dictatorships are full of the best intentions and that their intervention has, for the moment, saved European civilization. The merit that Fascism has thereby won for itself will live on eternally in history.</em> "</li>
    <li><a style="font-size: medium;" href="http://www.counterpunch.org/2006/11/17/the-road-from-serfdom/">Libertarian economist Milton Friedman and his colleagues personally met with Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet and his policy advice became a "guiding light" for the dictator's economic policies. </a>After his role sparked public outrage in the United States Friedman stated that Pinochet's military dictatorship offered  "more room for individual initiative and for a private sphere of life" than the democratically elected government that preceded it.</li>
    <li>John Laughland, <a style="font-size: medium;" href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/04/25/the-ron-paul-institute-be-afraid-very-afraid.html">member of the advisory board of the Ron Paul Institute for Peace and Prosperity</a>, calls the NATO intervention against Slobodan Milosevic<a style="font-size: medium;" href="http://www.balkanstudies.org/articles/srebrenica-genocide-totem-new-world-order"> "A Totem for the New World Order" and denies that the genocide that triggered it ever took place</a>.He believes that the reason Milosevic was removed is that “Washington is promoting a system of political and military control not unlike that once practiced by the Soviet Union.”</li>
    <li>Lets switch from crazy uncle Ron's institute to his son. When interviewed about his opinions on the Syrian conflict <a style="font-size: medium;" href="http://littlegreenfootballs.com/article/42465_Rand_Paul-_We_Should_Leave_Assad_Alone_Because_Hes_Only_Killing_Muslims">Rand Paul had this to say</a> <em style="font-size: medium;">“I don’t see American interests involved on either side of this Syrian war. I see [Bashar] Assad, who has protected Christians for a number of decades, and Islamic rebels on the other side who have been attacking Christians</em>”. <a style="font-size: medium;" href="http://www.salon.com/2013/08/30/ron_paul_syria_is_a_false_flag/">Ron Paul thinks Assad may be getting set up </a> As a responce to the question “Oh, so you question whether Assad even used the gas, of if he’s just being set up?”, asked during an interview with Fox News. Paul responded  "<em style="font-size: medium;">just look at how many lies were told us about Saddam Hussein prior to that buildup. More propaganda. It happens all the time. I think it’s a false flag. I think really, indeed.</em>"</li>
    <li><a style="font-size: medium;" href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/2012/03/marwood-dent-a-pseudonym/thoughts-on-singapore/">Libertarian commentator Lew Rockwell published </a>an article praising Singapore on his website. The article stated that "<em>it is a myth that democracies (read: dictatorship of the masses) by definition offer more benevolent living conditions. In my experience, democracies have seeds of self-destruction. Singapore, on the other hand, is more like a family-run corporation – a political system I prefer over democracy. Here I don’t see any busybodies around. ....They are nowhere close to an ideal government, but compared to what you get elsewhere, Singapore is a treat.</em> " The article then discussed the political oppression and restrictions on freedom of speech in the single party state and argues that these restrictions are good for liberty "<em>Quite honestly, if more freedom of speech were allowed in Singapore, it would likely also degenerate into a 'dictatorship of the mobs' in which Peter lobbies or protests to steal what is Paul’s</em>."</li>
