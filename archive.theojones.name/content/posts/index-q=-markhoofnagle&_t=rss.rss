<p><em>This post is part of a series <a title="Blog Post Series on the History of Sustainable Energy and Climate Change Politics" href="https://theojones.name/index.php/blog-post-series-on-the-history-of-sustainable-energy-and-climate-change-politics/">on the history of the politics of sustainable energy</a> <br /></em><a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/about/">According to science blogger Mark Hoofnagle</a>, “Denialism is the employment of rhetorical <br />tactics to give the appearance of argument or legitimate debate, when in actuality there is none.” He argues that these techniques are primarily <strong>“conspiracy, selectivity (cherry-picking), fake experts, impossible expectations (also known as moving goalposts), and general fallacies of logic.</strong>” Emphasis as in original source.</p>

<p>Climate scientist Michael Mann states that climate change denialist arguments fall into “six stages of denial”, in his book <em>The Hockey Stick and the Climate Wars: Dispatches from the Front Lines</em>. Climate change denialists have shifted down the stages of denial as the evidence for the mainstream view on climate change has become stronger-- but all six claims are regularly made. I argue that popular works and political commentators are the most likely to be in the first stages of denial and academic works in the social sciences are the most likely to use the arguments in the higher stages. The first stage is claims that argue that “CO2 is not actually increasing”. However, the rise in CO2 claimed by mainstream researchers has been confirmed by study after study and can be predicted by basic chemistry and physics relations. So, denialists have gradually had to abandon this argument. They then switched to claiming, as Mann puts it, “The increase has no impact on the climate since there is no convincing evidence of warming”. The warming effect of CO2 increases is a bit harder to calculate and predict accurately, but decades of  research on climate change since the 1970s has created a scientific consensus that human produced CO2 is causing potentially harmful levels of warming, so this argument has been slowly abandoned.In the next two steps, denialists try to claim that most observed warming is natural: “3) Even if there is warming, it is due to natural causes 4) Even if the warming cannot be explained by natural causes, the human impact is small, and the impact of continued greenhouse gas emissions will be minor.” But humans have been shown to be the cause of almost all climate change. Scientists have been better able to predict the effects of CO 2 emissions and the effects that they will have on the climate. “5) ...the changes are generally going to be good for us 6) ...it's too late to do anything about it , and/or a technological fix is bound to come along...“ These are the most nuanced of the “stages of denial”. All six of the steps in the “stages of denial” have been shown to be incorrect and are considered to be false by the great majority of scientists. Therefore, an argument that makes any of these claims can be classified as climate change denialism. A viewpoint on climate change that disputes these claims of denialists can be interpreted as concurring with the mainstream scientific view.</p>
