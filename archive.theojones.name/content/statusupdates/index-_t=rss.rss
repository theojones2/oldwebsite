"Facebook has long been keen for more journalists to use their personal accounts like they do Twitter &ndash; to engage with followers, discuss their articles and hunt for information. The company hasn&rsquo;t had much success on this front to date, but&nbsp;that may be starting to&nbsp;change. It&rsquo;s built a &lsquo;parallel universe&rsquo; for journalists to use with their personal accounts, and it&rsquo;s just like Twitter."<br />

"Now a rising star in the race for the Republican presidential nomination, Fiorina, 61, has pointed to her leadership of the printer and computer giant to showcase her corporate savvy and courage under fire. She has blamed the dot-com bust, sexism and an ineffective board of directors for helping sink what was then a global juggernaut.<br />
<br />
But in interviews with more than two dozen former HP senior directors and employees, many remember Fiorina’s legacy as troubling and divisive: A high-energy marketer, she nevertheless failed to deliver on lofty promises, alienated her workforce and presided over a disastrous reign at what was once a Silicon Valley pioneer."</p>
