<p><!--StartFragment--><a href="http://www.countthecosts.org/seven-costs/wasting-billions-drug-law-enforcement#%281%29">Current drug laws cost the global economy at least 100 billion dollars per year.</a> Imagine what we could do with that money if it were instead spent on something like healthcare, education, reducing non-drug crimes or alleviating poverty. Instead of spending this money on something that is useful to the nation we chose to spend it on an ineffective policy that increases crime and jams our courts and spreads disease. There is an alternative</p>

<p>to this policy. I advocate the legalization of mild drugs such as marijuana and the decriminalization of hard drugs. This policy will treat marijuana like alcohol and tobacco and will treat the hard drugs such as cocaine as a public health issue instead of a criminal problem. If we decriminalize drug use the government will not continue to try to tell millions of people throughout this country what chemicals they can or can not voluntarily put into their bodies. Decriminalizing drugs will reduce non drug crimes and will free up law enforcement resources to prosecute other more important crimes. Legalizing drugs is a good policy.</p>

<p>Despite all of the money that we spend on keeping drugs illegal this policy is not working. Millions throughout this country still use illegal drugs.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult_lifetime_cannabis_use_by_country"> Over 100 million Americans over the age of 12 have used marijuana at least once during their lives.</a> According a survey by the<a href="http://oas.samhsa.gov/NSDUH/2k10NSDUH/2k10Results.htm"> Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 7.8% of high school seniors surveyed said that they have used cocaine,</a> 16.8% have used amphetamines (speed) , 12% have used hallucinogenic drugs and 47.8 have used marijuana. Is this what we are paying tens of billions of dollars for? Why as a country are we paying billions of dollars to enforce laws that tens of millions people regularly violate? What does trying to enforce an unenforceable law do to the public’s respect of our government and the laws it makes?</p>

<p>I believe that we should adopt the marijuana policy that the Netherlands currently uses. In the Netherlands highly regulated “coffee shops” can sell marijuana to adults. Unlike drug dealers in the U.S “coffee shop” owners in the Netherlands are subject to strict regulation over the quality and safety of their products. A “coffee shop” is prevented from advertising , selling hard drugs or alcohol , selling more than five grams of marijuana during any single transaction or operating within 250 meters of a school.</p>

<p>If our government adopted the same policy as Netherlands of allowing highly regulated stores to legally sell marijuana it would take the crime and violence out of the trade of this drug. Doing this would make it harder for minors to obtain marijuana because the legal stores would have no incentive to risk getting shut down by breaking the law by selling to minors. Legalizing marijuana would also generate tax revenue because unlike the drug dealers the legal sellers of marijuana would pay sales and excise taxes.</p>

<p>I would recommend I policy of drug decriminalization to deal with the “hard” drugs such as cocaine. This policy would be along the lines of the one that currently exists for heroin addicts in Switzerland. Swiss heroin addicts can go to one of 22 government operated clinics to receive a safe,clean and free shot of heroin. While they are at the clinic the addicts will be informed about treatment they can receive to end their addiction. Social workers at the clinics will encourage addicts to seek rehab. The clinics are the only entity that may legally distribute the drugs. Possession of drugs is not prosecuted but drug dealers are. If the U.S adopted this system the illegal drug dealers would soon be out of business as there is no way that they can compete with the clinics that distribute the drugs for free. There will no longer be drug dealers shooting each other in the streets. The drugs distributed by the clinic will be at a constant and safe dosage so there will be a much lower risk of addicts dieing of drug overdose. The drugs will be administered through safe needles, so diseases will no longer be spread through unsafe injections . There will no longer be any more drug dealers to encourage children to take up drugs . The only legal distributor of drugs will be encouraging its clients to kick their drug habit instead of trying to find new clients.</p>

<p>Drug use in the U.S causes many public health issues. These issues can be resolved by drug use decriminalization. In 2001 Portugal decriminalized drug use. <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=portugal-drug-decriminalization">According to an article published in Scientific American the number of new cases of HIV caused by unsafe injections of drugs went from almost 1400 in 2001 to 400 in 2006</a>. Imagine how many lives could be saved if a policy of drug decriminalization was adopted in the U.S and that policy had a similar effect. According to a 2002 fact sheet published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a Federal Government agency unsafe injections of illegal drugs account for over one third of all cases of HIV. An estimated 11,635 people per year in the United States get HIV through unsafe injections of illegal drugs. Other countries that have taken the path of drug decriminalization have had similar reductions in HIV rates. According to the World Health Organization the percentage of users of injected drugs that have HIV declined from 5% in 1991 to 1% in 2006 . It is clear that our current drug policy is a public health disaster and that it will make for a healthier population if we decriminalize drugs</p>

<p>We have already done something similar to our current drug policy. In 1920 the 18th amendment to the constitution was ratified. Section one of it read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After one year from the ratification of this article the manufacture, sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors within, the importation thereof into, or the exportation thereof from the United States and all territory subject to the jurisdiction thereof for beverage purposes is hereby prohibited.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ratification of the 18th amendment brought prohibition into existence. Prohibition turned out in a similar way to our current drug policy. Millions of people throughout the country illegally consumed alcoholic beverages. The prohibition policy increased crime because the mafia became involved in the illegal distribution of alcoholic beverages. Just as thousands of people today are getting sick from unsafe injections of illegal drugs thousands died during prohibition because the illegal producers of alcoholic beverages would mix industrial (denatured) alcohol with their brews to create a stronger beverage. industrial alcohol sometimes contains the toxic methyl alcohol and this ended up killing people. When prohibition was replied legal breweries replaced the illegal ones, safe regulated producers of alcoholic beverages replaced the mafia and a law that millions violated went away .</p>

<p>To those who think that drugs are dangerous because they cause violent crimes I have a response. Much of the crime involved with drugs is because of our current drug policy. Drug dealers shoot each other on the streets over turf to sell their products. Terrorist organizations are funded by the illegal drug trade. A study published by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime found that the Taliban received between 50 to 70 million dollars in revenue through the opium trade. These problems would go away after regulated, legal producers of drugs out competed the drug smugglers.</p>

<p>There is also a moral issue involved here. Why should the government prevent someone from putting a chemical into his or her body if that person willingly does so with full knowledge of the damage possible. This is what the government is doing with it's current drug policies. A person that takes drugs is not harming anyone else. If a addict happens to commit another crime while on drugs then that is a separate issue and that person should be prosecuted for the non-drug crime. However, prosecuting someone because they just put a certain chemical into their bodies takes away part of their right to privacy and their right to control what happens to their own body.</p>

<p>Legalizing drugs will benefit public health, reduce violence and eliminate a law that millions violate each day. We are repeating what happened with Prohibition but just with another substance. Repealing our drug laws will remove a funding source from criminal organizations and will stop drug violence. Replacing our drug laws will reduce infections from unsafe injections and will replace the unregulated drug dealers with a system of regulated manufacturers. It is past time to repeal our drug laws and replace them with something more reasonable.   <!--EndFragment--></p>
