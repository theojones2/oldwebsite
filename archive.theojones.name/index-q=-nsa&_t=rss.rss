<p><i><a href="https://theojones.name/blog-post-series-on-the-history-of-sustainable-energy-and-climate-change-politics/">This is part of a blog post series on climate change.</a></i>In this post I am using a new way of doing citations that I will use in some of my longer posts. The citations can be found at the end notes/</p>

<p>The opposition to the development of nuclear energy was probably one of the worst mistakes the movement has ever made. A rapid conversion to nuclear energy in the 1970s – like the one France did – would have vastly reduced greenhouse gas emissions. France’s per capita greenhouse gas emissions (mostly due to cars, and heating fuel) is substantially less than the EU average, and a little over a third of the GHG emissions of the United States.

<p>sources have higher environmental impact than nuclear due to the large levels of natural resources needed to make wind and solar collectors, and due to the land-use of renewable sources. Nuclear is at cost parity with fossil fuels (even unsubsidized), while renewable still cost substantially more than traditional sources. The environmental opposition to nuclear energy has largely come out of two places. 1) the opposition to nuclear weapons (note the ”peace” in ”Greenpeace”), 2) a general technophobia. I will discuss both of these trends in this section. The relation between opposition to nuclear weapons, and the opposition to nuclear energy certainly exists for Greenpeace. The group was founded in part to oppose a nuclear weapons test on the Alaskan island of Amchitka. There were some concerns that this test could trigger geologic events like earthquakes or tsunamis. Greenpeace eventually formed out a group of (mostly Quaker) protesters opposing this event. Some of their tactics were opposed by established environmental groups – like the Sierra Club. Greenpeace’s website declares that <i>”motivated by their vision of a green and peaceful world, a small team of activists set sail from Vancouver, Canada in an old fishing boat. These activists, the founders of Greenpeace, believed a few individuals could make a difference... Amchitka was the last refuge for 3,000 endangered sea otters, and home to bald eagles, peregrine falcons, and other wildlife.”</i>[2].After this fissure with the environmental movement they eventually formed their own organization. Even today Greenpeace’s states that their mission includes the following goal ”<i>Working for disarmament and peace by reducing dependence on finite resources and calling for the elimination of all nuclear weapons.</i>” [3]. The group has even recently been involved in anti-war protests. In June of 2014 the group conducted a protest against NSA surveillance, and the construction of a new NSA data center [4]. Greenpeace is opposed to civilian nuclear energy and considers nuclear energy as a potential source of nuclear proflarition. They argue that the ability of nuclear energy to mitigate climate change is minor. They argue that the energy source has a high risk of accident, argue that nuclear energy has strong environmental impacts, and that nuclear energy is plagued by slow construction times, and dramatic cost overruns. They also argue that it competes with renewable energy for funding. I will discuss the ability for nuclear energy to mitigate climate change elsewhere, – in short it is very large. In fact it is possible to create a climate mitigation strategy that largely reilyes on nuclear energy. The construction times of nuclear energy are not a product of the technology but instead a product of the regulatory environment and finance. Nuclear energy construction times in France during the 1970s were around two years – similar to the construction times of renewable energy projects. Construction times in the U.S in the 50s and 60s were also around two years. There have been no major accidents at any of these projects. A major difference between these projects and modern ones is that these rapidly completed projects were generally publicly owned. Public or quasi-public ownership may be the preferable way to manage energy projects. With nuclear energy there is a general conflict of interest with the profit role and the public safety role. This produces a risk of an extrenality cost, and this is only mitigated by a expensive regulatory process. Public ownership avoids this conflict of interest. I would also argue that similar conflicts of interest have the potential to occur with renewable energy. There will be a large number of subsidies and government funding available to privately owned renewable energy firms, and it will be a tough regulatory challenge to provide that these funds are well-used. Later, I will discuss a proposal for quasi-public ownership of energy infrastructure that still allows for reasonable market pressure. In reality the opposition to nuclear energy has been one of the largest delays in the mitigation of climate change.</p>

<p>To the credit of Greenpeace, they have been one of the most vocal proponents of action on climate change. They call climate change ”the number one threat facing our planet”. They argue for a rapid mitigation of the threat. In their plan developed nation emissions would be reduced by 40 percent by 2020 and global emissions would be reduced to near zero. The group has also been a major contributor to activism on other environmental issues.<br />There is another source of opposition to nuclear energy. A general opposi tion of projects perceived to be non-”natural” over projects perceived to have a ”natural” basis. Even when the more ”natural” project is worse for the environment. This comes with a general embrace of pseudoscience within the more hardline elements environmental community, and a general opposition to technology. A lot of this conception of ”naturalness” comes from a vague perception of semi-vitalism – a belief that living/”natural” things have some property beyond their mere chemical composition. There is no scientific evidence for such a claim, but it is common/implied in arguments for ”alternative” (read: useless) medicine, organic foods (the certification for these foods is a mix of things that do some good, and things that are net harmful), opposition to the use of pesticides (which often net help the environment by reducing land use) and other issues. This perception, I believe, is at the core of a lot of the opposition to technological innovations among environmental groups. This is the most clear in the arguments against GMO crops.<br />The claims made by the campaigners against genetically modified foods are simply absurd. This ideology’s claims about the health effects of GMOs are as discredited in the scientific community as creationism or global warming denialism and all major scientific associations of repute that have looked into the issue disavow it. Their position that a compound can suddenly become toxic when synthesized due to a genetic modification of a plant, but is not toxic when synthesized by a natural process violates the laws of physics, chemistry and biology (It is worth noting that the BT toxin – a common product of genetic modification – is also a commonly used pest control in organic food, due to the fact that it is produced in the bacterium <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i>) Their understanding of the economics of these products is not much better. These compounds have passed the approval of the FDA and the EPA. our food is not being poisoned by Monsanto (or the Illuminati, or whoever else the people at Natural News are blaming today). While Monsanto and its ilk have business practices that are very good, the same can be said of major players in almost every industry in the world. In my opinion this ”movement” is just dressed-up ludditeism – both in the modern sense of general technophobia, and in the sense of the historical Luddite movement’s belief that the abuses of sweatshops were an inevitable outcome of the automation of textile production.<br />Technophobia is a core undercurrent of the anti-GMO ideology. When you read their discussions about ”frankenfoods” (of course ignoring the fact that almost all domesticated plants and animals differ greatly from their wild relatives) they are employing the idea that new technology is inherently bad and dangerous, while the ”natural” is inherently good and safe. Nothing of the kind is true. Technology has a great ability to improve our standard of living and there are many things that ”natural” Of course there are also harmful synthetic products.I put the word ”natural” in quotes because man-made things and ”natural” products are created by the same laws of physics. In reality,<br />everything in this universe is natural. To the anti-GMO activist, ”natural” just means created with recently invented technology and this technology is scary.<br />Like the historical Luddites who blamed technology for the ills of the textile industry, when these issues were really created by unethical business practices,anti-GMO activists claim that the bad behavior of business is the unavoidable result of technology. These activists (rightly) criticize the patent litigation of Monsanto. However, instead of seeing this as another symptom of a broken patent system, they inexplicably blame the technology. These activists (rightly) see a greedy monopolist in Monsanto but they blame the technology instead of calling for anti-trust reform. This attitude will only serve to hold back the progress made possible by technology, without dealing with the systemic issues that allowed these unethicalbusiness practices. Rest assured that even without GMO foods, these economic issues will continue to wreak havoc in other sectors of the economy.A common third way approach to the GMO issue is labling. Now I will discuss why GMO labeling is a terrible idea. There is no scientific basis to fear GMO products.The claimed consumer choice benefits of mandatory labeling can be fulfilled by private certifications and currently existing, government ran certification programs.Due to the dynamics of food markets, mandatory GMO labeling amounts to a defacto GMO ban. This will increase food prices and possibly add to the environmental damage cause by agriculture.The World Health Organization notes ”GM foods currently available on the international market have passed risk assessments and are not likely to present risks for human health”.The American Association for the Advancement of Science concluded that ”Several current efforts to require labeling of GM foods are not being driven by any credible scientific evidence that these foods are dangerous” and that ”GM crops are the most extensively tested crops ever”.Their report also noted that labeling could mislead and falsely alarm consumers.<br />All of the claimed consumer choice benefits of GMO labeling can be done by voluntary certification. All products currently sold as organic in the U.S lack GMO products. Private certifications are also very good at assuring that products are prepared in accordance to standards that are sufficient for their consumers. Note that there are many private companies which certify kosher products. Economies of scale in food production make it inefficient and cost prohibitive for companies to create separate product lines with GMO and non-GMO foods. Therefore, just one of these options will be taken.If the labeling causes a substantial minority of the population to avoid GMO foods then these foods will be forced off the market for everyone. This has already happened in Europe, where GMO labeling is mandatory. In fact, the push for labeling by the anti-GMO movement is just a pretext to regulate these products out of existence.This will harm consumers and the environment because GMO products require less land usage than their competitors. The price of this extra land will be passed on to consumers, along with the price of increased crop loss. This increased land usage will also have substantial environmental impacts. However, there will be no clear economic benefits to this defacto ban on GMO foods.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<div>
        <p>Time's <a href="http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,2164806-1,00.html">most recent cover article</a> was about a quantum computer produced by startup D-Wave. However, this article is deeply flawed and represents severe problems that pervade science journalism  </p><ol><li>Time's writer has no expertise in the relevant subject matters. Quantum computing involves very complex issues in computer science and physics. Time assigned the story to their book critic who has a degree in literature.</li>
    <li>Time's story gives equal weight to the claims made in D-Wave's advertising, and to the relevant published research done by independent computer scientists and physicists. The academic research gives strong reasons to doubt the plausibility of many of D-Wave's claims.</li>
    <li>The story has a multitude of outright errors and misleading statements.</li>
</ol><p>D-Wave has developed a special purpose quantum computer. The computer you are reading this on is a general purpose computer -- it can do any mathematical calculation that you want. On the other hand D-Wave's computer is optimized to solve only one problem, discrete combinatorial optimization, which has applications in engineering. D-Wave's computer can do one thing that your computer cannot, use quantum mechanical effects to aid the solving of this problem. There is however one problem that did not get enough play in Time's story, independent researchers have not been able to verify that D-Wave's quantum computer is any better at solving this problem than a classical computer, or even that quantum computers in general are better at this problem.</p><!--more--><p>The issues with the Time article start with the first paragraph.  </p><blockquote>
<p>For years astronomers have believed that the coldest place in the universe is a massive gas cloud 5,000 light-years from Earth called the Boomerang Nebula. ...</p>

<p>But as it turns out, the scientists have been off by about 5,000 light-years. The coldest place in the universe is actually in a small city directly east of Vancouver called Burnaby.</p>
</blockquote><p>Two issues here  </p><ol><li>The Boomerang is the the coldest known <em>natural</em> object, artificial experiments have long gone below this level</li>
    <li>The internals of the D-Wave computer are <em>NOT</em> the coldest man-made object</li>
</ol><p>Now lets look at the last paragraph of the article preview  </p><blockquote>
<p>The reason D-Wave has so few customers is that it makes a new type of computer called a quantum computer that's so radical and strange, people are still trying to figure out what it's for and how to use it. .... it has the potential to solve problems that would take conventional computers centuries, with revolutionary consequences for fields ranging from cryptography to nanotechnology, pharmaceuticals to artificial intelligence.</p>
</blockquote><p>I'm tempted to tone down the flameage on this one because the issues in this paragraph are corrected later in the article. However, this is the last paragraph that is below the fold. So, this will be as far as many readers read. And this paragraph is incorrect when taken by itself. As I noted above, the D-Wave is a special purpose computer. Its not useful at running Shor's algorithm, or Grover's algorithm -- the two quantum algorithms with relevance to cryptography. It can just solve the discrete combinatorial optimization problem, which has much more limited use.  </p><blockquote>
<p>.... But D-Wave's customers buy them anyway, for around $10 million a pop, because if they're the real deal they could be the biggest leap forward since the invention of the microprocessor.</p>
</blockquote><p>Same issue here. Classical computers do a lot more than just solve one math problem.</p><p>The discussion of the history of quantum mechanics is pretty good. There is one sentence that I would take exception to  </p><blockquote>
<p>Einstein ultimately found quantum mechanics so monstrously counterintuitive that he rejected it as either wrong or profoundly incomplete. As he famously put it, "I cannot believe that God plays dice with the world."</p>
</blockquote><p>Einstein didn't reject quantum mechanics, he argued for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensemble_Interpretation">ensemble interpretation</a> which attempts to explain quantum effects in terms of statistical aggregates of particles.  </p><blockquote>
<p>The supercooled niobium chip at the heart of the D-Wave Two has 512 qubits and therefore could in theory perform 2<sup>512</sup> operations simultaneously.</p>
</blockquote><p>Bzzt!! Quantum computers don't do 2<sup>512</sup> operations simultaneously. The quantum computer does an operation that pretty much amounts to randomly guessing at the right answer. The qubits then undergo what is known as entanglement.  At this point you can imagine  2<sup>512</sup> parallel universes with their own parallel qubits. These "virtual" qubits interact, and eventually they decohenere into a state where only one set of qubits is observed. At first glance it looks like you just have quantum <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogosort">bogosort</a> -- most of the possible guesses are incorrect. But in fact, during the period of time when the "virtual" qubits are entangled and interacting, and when the problem being solved follows certain patterns it is possible to "stack the deck" and increase the probability that the correct answer will be the one observed.  </p><blockquote>
<p>One of the documents leaked by Edward Snowden, published last month, revealed that the NSA has an $80 million quantum-computing project suggestively code-named Penetrating Hard Targets. Here's why: much of the encryption used online is based on the fact that it can take conventional computers years to find the factors of a number that is the product of two large primes. A quantum computer could do it so fast that it would render a lot of encryption obsolete overnight. You can see why the NSA would take an interest.</p>
</blockquote><p>Correct but confusing. Contrary to the impression that you would get so far in the article, the D-Wave computer cannot solve these cryptographic problems.</p><p>The article then goes into a two-page speel about how great the inventors of the D-Wave computer how, and how great the technique they invented is. -- All without any mention of the objection from the academic community.  </p><blockquote>
<p>For example, you can't as yet perform the kind of cryptographic wizardry the NSA was interested in, because an adiabatic quantum computer won't run the right algorithm. It's a special-purpose tool. "You take your general-purpose chip," Rose says, "and you do a bunch of inefficient stuff that generates megawatts of heat and takes forever, and you can get the answer out of it. But this thing, with a picowatt and a microsecond, does the same thing. So it's just doing something very specific, very fast, very efficiently."</p>
</blockquote><p>Finally on page five out of eight.  </p><blockquote>
<p>This is great if you have a really hard discrete combinatorial optimization problem to solve. Not everybody does. But once you start looking for optimization problems, or at least problems that can be twisted around to look like optimization problems, you find them all over the place: in software design, tumor treatments, logistical planning, the stock market, airline schedules, the search for Earth-like planets in other solar systems, and in particular in machine learning.</p>
</blockquote><p>No mention of how no one has been able to prove that quantum computers can actually solve the discrete combinatorial optimization problem in a way thats appreciably more effective than classical computers.</p><p>The article then continues on about how great the D-wave people are, and how big name companies have bought their stuff for another page.</p><p>On the last page of the article Time gets to D-Wave's critics, but portrays them as a bunch of ivory tower eggheads that are a bit too removed from real life -- instead of a sizeable portion of those who are capable of evaluating D-Wave's claims.  </p><blockquote>
<p>Another challenge rose and company face is that there is a small but nonzero number of academic physicists and computer scientists who think that they are partly or completely full of sh-t. Ever since D-Wave's first demo in 2007, snide humor, polite skepticism, impolite skepticism and outright debunkings have been lobbed at the company from any number of ivory towers. "There are many who in Round 1 of this started trash-talking D-Wave before they'd ever met the company," Jurvetson says.</p>
</blockquote><p>Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.  </p><blockquote>
<p>Any blog post or news story about D-Wave instantly grows a shaggy beard of vehement comments, both pro- and anti-.</p>
</blockquote><p>Yup.  </p><blockquote>
<p> The critics argue that D-Wave is insufficiently transparent,</p>
</blockquote><p>Then D-Wave should release more information about how their computer works. Reproducibility of your results is an important part of science.  </p><blockquote>
<p>that its adiabatic approach is unpromising, that its machines are no faster than classical computers</p>
</blockquote><p>Then they should release evidence that quantum computers can solve the discrete combinatorial optimization problem faster than a classical computer. <br />
Lets check what actual physicists say about this dispute then.  </p><blockquote>
<p>Last month a team including Matthias Troyer, an internationally respected professor of computational physics at ETH Zurich, attempted to clarify things with a report based on an extensive series of tests pitting Google's D-Wave Two against classical computers solving randomly chosen problems. Verdict? To quote from the study: "We find no evidence of quantum speedup when the entire data set is considered and obtain inconclusive results when comparing subsets of instances on an instance-by-instance basis." This has, not surprisingly, generally been interpreted as a conspicuous failure for D-Wave.</p>
</blockquote><p>But this analysis would not be complete without looking at more of D-Wave's advertising, would it?  </p><blockquote>
<p>But where quantum computing is concerned, there always seems to be room for disagreement.</p>
</blockquote><p>No. Where journalists are involved there always seems to be room for disagreement.  </p><blockquote>
<p>The attitude in D-Wave's C-suite toward all this back-and-forth is, unsurprisingly, dismissive. "The people that really understand what we're doing aren't skeptical," says Brownell. Rose is equally calm about it; all that wrestling must have left him with a thick skin. "Unfortunately," he says, "like all discourse on the Internet, it tends to be driven by a small number of people that are both vocal and not necessarily the most informed."</p>
</blockquote><p>Thats some real peer reviewed research Time has there. A D-Wave employee saying that "The people that really understand what we're doing aren't skeptical" really proves that their computer works.</p><p><a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/bzztquantum" class="p-category" rel="tag">#bzztquantum</a> <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/edwardsnowden" class="p-category" rel="tag">#edwardsnowden</a> <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/matthiastroyer" class="p-category" rel="tag">#matthiastroyer</a> <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/nsa" class="p-category" rel="tag">#nsa</a> <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/old" class="p-category" rel="tag">#old</a> <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/old" class="p-category" rel="tag">#old</a> <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/uncategorized" class="p-category" rel="tag">#uncategorized</a></p></div>]]></description>

<p>While there are many things we should be concerned about with the NSA's vast data collection programs, in my opinion the worst is the fact that politicians are making many critical decisions about our privacy rights in secret without public debate. This secrecy is an assault on the basic principles of the rule of law and democracy.</p>

<p>As the<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/07/us/in-secret-court-vastly-broadens-powers-of-nsa.html?pagewanted=all&_r=1&"> New York Times reports t</a>he court has "created a secret body of law" and has assumed a role that is greatly beyond its initial purpose of "approving case-by-case wiretapping orders". In secret, and without making public any justifications for its decisions, the court has approved vast data collection programs. <a href="http://wonkette.com/521997/fisa-court-busy-making-awesome-secret-law-awesomely-in-secret">Additionally</a> the court , has reinterpreted the definition of “foreign intelligence” to include not just communications involving a foreign national, but also many communications between Americans. The FISA court <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/08/new-leak-nsa-can-search-us-e-mail-data-but-theoretically-isnt-allowed-to/">has declared</a> that the NSA can collect all American email data and create a system that allows this data to be searched -- even when the emails are between Americans using an American service provider. It is likely that the NSA has used this power to search American emails.Why won't the FISA court release summaries of its rulings? As the top judge on the court explains, the public <a href="http://www.fas.org/irp/agency/doj/fisa/fisc-032713.pdf">cannot be trusted to "understand"</a> the decisions -- especially after important details are edited out of released opinions. Furthermore, actually giving the public even a summary of what the government is doing on its behalf would overwork the judges so much that the expanded workload  "would have a detrimental impact on the FISC's ability to address matters currently before the court" because "small number of judges, attorneys, and staff that comprise the FISC are fully occupied by its current caseload".</p>

<p>Why do I call this great secrecy the worst element of the NSA program? In a free society it is necessary that policy makers are held to governing in the public's interest, not their own. The only way to make sure that the government is held accountable is to create a political and legal system where voters and the public have the ability to effectively contest government policy. The public must know what the government is doing on its behalf in-order to evaluate the actions of the state. A secret court is unable to fully hear and take into account opposing arguments. Furthermore, even if the NSA program turns out to be legal, secret decisions cannot be contested on election day and the politicians who allowed the spying program will not face any consequences if they have made a bad call. It is ultimately the task of voters' to decide if the NSA programs have employed the proper level of protections for privacy but if the executive branch orders and court decisions allowing these programs are not known to the public, voters will not be able to make this evaluation.</p>
