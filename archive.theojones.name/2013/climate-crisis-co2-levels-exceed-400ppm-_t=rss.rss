<p><strong>This blog post is the first in a series where I will explore the science behind climate change, the effects of climate change and solutions to the climate change problem.  </strong></p><p>Earlier this month atmospheric carbon dioxide levels exceeded 400 parts per million for the first time in recorded history, <a href="http://www.skepticalscience.com/pliocene-snapshot.html"> and most likely for the first time in three million years</a>. The evidence is clear that climate change is occurring and that it is a very significant global problem. Global warming is primarily caused by humans and there are policy and economic changes that can reduce it in the future. Ninety-seven percent of climatologists agree with this mainstream view and no scientific body in the natural sciences of international standing disagrees with it.</p><p> As the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found in its most recent assessment, changes to the climate, caused by CO2 and other greenhouse gasses, will create extreme weather patterns,raise sea levels, and decrease sea ice levels. Global temperatures have increased to a level not exceeded for the last 125,000 years. Current changes to the climate will have effects that could last for hundreds of years. If measures are not taken to reduce current emissions levels, significant additional climate change will almost certainly happen.</p><p><a href="http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art32/main.html">A 2009 study found that</a> maintaining a climate and global ecosystem that is fundamentally similar to the one that has existed over the last 10,000 years will require the change in radiative forcing to be limited to 1 watt per square meter-- roughly equivalent to limiting CO2 levels to 350 parts per million. This is compared to current levels of 1.5 watts per square meter and 400 parts per million.The same paper also found that biodiversity loss has already increased to more than 10 times a sustainable or desirable level and found human-caused disruptions to the nitrogen cycle that exceeded what ecosystems can sustain without severe disruption.</p><p>To restore CO2 levels to this sustainable level is possible but will take a massive investment and this investment must start now. However, the fact that CO2 levels were allowed to reach 400 without any urgent climate change mitigation plan in sight shows that we are not currently on a sustainable path and that substantial additional action is needed to prevent a calamity.</p><p><a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/climatechange" class="p-category" rel="tag">#climatechange</a> <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/old" class="p-category" rel="tag">#old</a> <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/old" class="p-category" rel="tag">#old</a> <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/uncategorized" class="p-category" rel="tag">#uncategorized</a></p></div>]]></description>
