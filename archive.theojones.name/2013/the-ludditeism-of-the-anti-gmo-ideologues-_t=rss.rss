<p>The claims made by the campaigners against genetically modified foods are simply absurd. This ideology's claims about the health effects of GMOs are as discredited in the scientific community as creationism or global warming denialism and all major scientific associations of repute</p>

<p>that have looked into the issue disavow it.  Their position that a compound can suddenly become toxic when synthesized due to a genetic modification of a plant, but is not toxic when synthesized by a natural process violates the laws of physics, chemistry and biology [1. It is worth noting that the BT toxin -- a common product of genetic modification -- is also a commonly used pest control in organic food, due to the fact that it is produced in the bacterium <em>Bacillus thuringiensis</em>]. Their understanding of the economics of these products is not much better. These compounds have passed the approval of the FDA and the EPA. Your food is not being poisoned by <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">the Illuminati</span> Monsanto. While Monsanto and its ilk are filled with greedy SOBs, the same can be said of major players of almost every industry in the world. In my opinion this "movement" is just dressed-up ludditeism -- both in the modern sense of general technophobia, and in the sense of the historical Luddite movement's belief that the abuses of sweatshops were an inevitable outcome of the automation of textile production.</p>

<p>Technophobia is a core undercurrent of the anti-GMO ideology. When you read their discussions about "frankenfoods" (of course ignoring the fact that almost all domesticated plants and animals differ greatly from their wild relatives) they are employing the idea that new technology is inherently bad and dangerous, while the "natural" is inherently good and safe. Nothing of the kind is true. Technology has a great ability to improve our standard of living and there are many things that "natural"   Of course there are also harmful synthetic products.I put the word "natural" in quotes because man-made things and "natural" products are created by the same laws of physics. In reality, everything in this universe is natural. To the anti-GMO activist, "natural" just means created with recently invented technology and this technology is scary.</p>

<p>Like the historical Luddites who blamed technology for the ills of the textile industry, when these issues were really created by unethical business practices, anti-GMO activists claim that the bad behavior of business is the unavoidable result of technology. These activists (rightly) criticize the patent litigation of Monsanto. However, instead of seeing this as another symptom of a broken patent system, they inexplicably blame the technology. These activists (rightly) see a greedy monopolist  in Monsanto but they blame the technology instead of calling for anti-trust reform. This attitude will only serve to hold back the progress made possible by technology, without dealing with the systemic issues that allowed these unethical business practices. Rest assured that even without GMO foods, these economic issues will continue to wreak havoc in other sectors of the economy.</p>
