<p><a title="Pre-funding Energy Consumption: A Proposal to Encourage Energy Efficiency of Consumer Products" href="https://theojones.name/index.php/pre-funding-energy-consumption-proposal-encourage-energy-efficiency-consumer-products/">A while ago I introduced a way that governments could encourage increased energy efficiency</a>. In this followup post I will discuss why energy efficiency is important. Improvements to America's energy efficiency is one of the quickest ways that pollution can be reduced. This change can also save vast amounts of money. <a href="http://www.worldwatch.org/node/6212">One report on energy efficiency</a> showed that a one time investment of 520 billion dollars in energy efficiency could reduce energy usage by about 25%</p>

<p>and save over one trillion dollars.One trillion dollars is about $3200 per every American and is equal to about 28 percent of the annual Federal budget. This energy efficiency investment would also reduce CO2 pollution by 1.1 billion tons of carbon dioxide per year. Other sources substantiate that there is a vast potential to improve America's energy use by efficiency.<br /><!--more--><br />Industry is one major sector of the economy where vast energy efficiency improvements are possible.<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544201000172">A 2001 paper</a> [1. Worrell, Ernst, Lynn Price, and Nathan Martin. "Energy efficiency and carbon dioxide emissions reduction opportunities in the US iron and steel sector." Energy 26.5 (2001): 513-536.] showed that with current technology the energy efficiency of the American steel industry could be increased by 18 percent. This would result in a 19% reduction of that industry's emissions. It was estimated that these improvements would pay for themselves within three years. Similarly, <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544200000426">a 2000 paper</a> [2. Worrell, Ernst, Nathan Martin, and Lynn Price. "Potentials for energy efficiency improvement in the US cement industry." Energy 25.12 (2000): 1189-1214.] found that an 11% reduction in the energy useage of the cement industry was possible and that this shift would reduce the emissions of American cement production by 5 percent. <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/31b2f7bd#page-3">A separate 2000 study</a> [3. Martin, Nathan, et al. "Opportunities to improve energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the US pulp and paper industry." (2000).] found that energy usage in the paper industry could be reduced by almost 37 percent. The paper industry accounts for 12 percent of industrial energy usage in America. This data shows that if all of the possible industrial energy efficiency improvements were made, then pollution could be greatly reduced and billions of dollars could be saved. <br />There are also massive ways that households could save energy. A 2009 study found that it is possible for American households to reduce their contributions to CO2 emissions by 20% [4. Dietz, Thomas, et al. "Household actions can provide a behavioral wedge to rapidly reduce US carbon emissions." Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 106.44 (2009): 18452-18456.].<a href="http://www.nohairshirts.com/chap17.php"> A calculation in a 2008 book</a> found that home heating, lighting and water energy usage could be reduced by 80% for newly constructed houses. Already constructed buildings can drive smaller but still substantial energy savings. The cash value of these savings is almost 3000 dollars per household per year.</p>
