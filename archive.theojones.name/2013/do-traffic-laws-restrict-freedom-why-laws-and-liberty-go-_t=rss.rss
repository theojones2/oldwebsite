<p>It is fashionable to believe that all laws and government regulations are a restriction on liberty.In-fact, the opposite is true, a society without any law is one that lacks liberty. A well structured system of laws when administered and drafted by a government that is accountable to the public can greatly expand freedom by expanding the range of actions that a typical person can do without being subject to the risk of arbitrary interference. To see why think about traffic laws. If these laws did not exist then the road would be useless to everyone. In a world without traffic regulations one could just blaze down the road at 100MPH, thereby impacting everyone else who uses the road. The range of actions the other road uses can take is reduced. Freedom is limited in this situation because the lack of regulation allows one to conduct dangerous actions that affect all other users of the road. The bad driver has the power to arbitrarily interfere with others. By passing laws these harms can be restricted. These laws expand freedom because allowing increased usage of the road expands the range of actions that the typical person can take without being subject to the risk of interference from another.  <br /><!--more--></p>
<p>Additionally,imagine a society with no government and no laws.In this world a wealthy/powerful person could just hire a hit-man to take out an opponent and no one could stop him. He would have almost absolute power over others.This power over potential targets would be almost as absolute as that possessed by a dictator who could have anyone eliminated at will and is fundamentally similar in nature. If fact a large part of the difference between dictators and the leaders of democratic nations comes from the fact that dictators are not bound by the law. </p><p>When do laws harm freedom? When the laws are not made and enforced by an authority bound to govern in the interests of the populace by rule of law, democracy and legally enforced human rights. Laws made otherwise can become tools to govern, not liberate the populace. But when these conditions are met government regulation expand liberty, instead of reducing it.  </p><p><a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/old" class="p-category" rel="tag">#old</a> <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/old" class="p-category" rel="tag">#old</a> <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/uncategorized" class="p-category" rel="tag">#uncategorized</a></p></div>]]></description>
