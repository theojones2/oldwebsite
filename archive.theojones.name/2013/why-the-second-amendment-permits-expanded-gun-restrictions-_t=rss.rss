<p>The Second Amendment does not forbid moderate gun regulations. While there is an individual right to keep and bear arms, both the history behind the Amendment and current legal interpretation does not make this right as broad and as absolute as freedom of speech and other civil liberties. This is because the Second Amendment created an individual right in order to serve a collective purpose. The framers of the constitution believed that an armed populace in near universal militia service was a vehicle to protect individual rights. While there is a right for individuals to keep and bear arms, some limits on this right are within the government's power.</p>

<p>The framers of the United States Bill of Rights planned a military system based around broad based service where most adult males were expected to serve in a militia. Gun ownership was to be part of this militia system. Individuals would keep their personal military weapon but be expected to participate in and be trained as part of the military service. This tying of national service and gun ownership created a system where gun ownership was common but not necessarily restriction free. The intent of the founders was to create a military and gun ownership system that would of been similar to the current Swiss system. The framers of the U.S Constitution were not uniformly opposed to standing armies, but believed that they were potentially dangerous and one way of containing this danger was universal service in militias and a therefore more limited standing army. In the founders' view a large militia with broad based service supplemented by a smaller standing army was the optimal military and the one best suited to preserve liberty. Additionally, the founders also viewed individual gun ownership outside of a militia as important to the public interest and as a necessary supplement to militia service.</p>

<p>The militia clause of the Amendment states the purpose of the Second Amendment but the "right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed" clause of the Amendment is the effective part of the amendment. The Amendment provided that "right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed" because an armed population and a "regulated militia" is "necessary to the security of a free state".</p>

<p>This history and the wording of the Second Amendment create make both the collective right view and the individual rights view of the Amendment partiality correct. But both views are too extreme and contain severe flaws. The Second Amendment created an individual right in order to serve a collective purpose. In the mind of the framers of the U.S Constitution an armed populace in near universal militia service was a vehicle to protect individual rights. Contrary to the collective rights view promoted by many gun control advocates there is an individual right to keep and bear arms. However, the pure individual rights view promoted by groups such as the National Rifle Association is also incorrect as many restrictions are permissible because wide spread gun ownership was viewed as a means to protect liberty and not a fundamental liberty in itself.</p>

<p>While there is a right for individuals to keep and bear arms, some limits on this right are within the government's power because the individual right portion of the Amendment can not be interpreted so broadly as to harm the public interest. The individual right to keep and bear arms should not be interpreted to provide an absolute right akin to freedom of speech or freedom of religion but should be instead interpreted to provide a weaker right.</p>

<p>Alexander Hamilton in <i>Federalist No. 29</i> explained both the utility of an nationally organized militia and how the formation of a militia relates to the general armament of the population (emphasis added).</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>It requires no skill in the science of war to discern that uniformity in the organization and discipline of the militia would be attended with the most beneficial effects, whenever they were called into service for the public defense. …. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">This desirable uniformity can only be accomplished by confiding the regulation of the militia to the direction of the national authority. ....<br /></span><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Little more can reasonably be aimed at with the respect to the people at large than to have them properly armed and equipped ; and in order to see that this be not neglected, it will be necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course of a year.</span></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However,in the Founders' view bearing arms had utility to the public outside just militia service. An armed population, especially one with high militia service created a decentralize way to protect liberty and to prevent the formation of an authoritarian regime. James Madison in Federalist No. 46 wrote</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Besides the advantage of being armed, which the Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation, the existence of subordinate governments,to which the people are attached, forms a barrier against the enterprises of ambition, more insurmountable than any which a simple government of any form can admit of. Notwithstanding the military establishments in the several kingdoms of Europe, which are carried as far as the public resources will bear, the governments are afraid to trust the people with arms. And it is not certain, that with this aid alone they would not be able to shake off their yokes. But were the people to possess the additional advantages of local governments chosen by themselves, who could collect the national will and direct the national force, and of officers appointed out of the militia, by these governments, and attached both to them and to the militia, it may be affirmed with the greatest assurance, that the throne of every tyranny in Europe would be speedily overturned in spite of the legions which surround it.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>While the second amendment protects individual gun ownership and prevents a complete gun ban , the rationale for protecting individual gun ownership is one based on protecting the collective interest. The Constitution does not forbid reasonable and necessary restrictions on the sale and distribution of firearms. This is consistent with current court rulings, which state that there is an individual right to keep and bear arms but allow for substantial limits on that right. The Supreme Court in the majority opinion in <i>District of Colombia vs Heller </i><i>(2008)</i> stated that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<i>Although we do not undertake an exhaustive historical analysis today of the full scope of the Second Amendment, nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.</i>”</p>
