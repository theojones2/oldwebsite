      <title>The Unusually Toxic Nature of Social Issues </title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div>
        <p>Speaker of the House John Boehner resigned earlier this week, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/dandiamond/2015/09/25/planned-parenthood-fight-costs-john-boehner-his-job/">in part due to the fight over funding for Planned Parenthood</a>.  Incidents like this show something that is fairly obvious to most people, that social issues are among the most persistently toxic issues. But why should abortion, gay marriage, and such be so at the core of U.S politics. Why should they be major litmus tests for both parties? By any reasonable measure these issues are pretty low impact for the level of attention they receive. By impact, they certanily aren’t as important as immigration, climate change, poverty, or other issues that have a very large effect on over all social well being. But there is a dearth of individuals writing flameage about urban planning on social media, nor are there government shutdowns about that topic, despite the fact that urban planning policy probably has a <a href="http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/chang-tai.hsieh/research/growth.pdf">much larger impact on the over-all wellbeing of the typical person </a></p><p>So, why do social issues produce the toxicity that they do? I have a few ideas</p><ul><li>The zero sum nature of them. A loss for one side is a gain for the other. Allowing gay marriage is a victory for those who want gay marriage but a loss those who don’t want it. Defunding Planned Parenthood means a rather direct loss for people who want to keep abortion services available, but it is a rather direct win for those opposed to abortion (ignoring indirect effects of contraceptive avaiability on the number of abortions).</li>
<li>The incommensurability of moral systems. The ethical assumptions that underlie one side <em>make no sense</em> from the other side. From the perspective of a supporter of abortion availability, the arguments of the other side seem like at best mindless superstition, and at worst outright sexism. From the perspective on an abortion opponent the other side seems like a villan from a James Bond movie. Likewise with gay marriage, the “family values” that conservatives are interested in promoting have close to no value to liberals.  This probably by its self produces a lot of the inability for the different sides to deal with each other -- they begin to perceive each other as downright evil. </li>
<li>The role of religion. The U.S is one of the few countries where religion is important enough to have a major political role, but not so powerful to totally dominate politics. This creates the clashes over social issues, as the U.S is really in a transitional point between religion and secularism. The importance of this is obvious from the conservative side, but I think there is a more subtle role here in the politics of the left. A lot of the social justice activism that plays out on social media, and on college campuses, seems to me like a secular substitute for religion — a replacement for its role in society. This would also explain a lot of the uniquely American aspects of these issues.  </li>
<li>The clearly disengenious nature of many of the arguements fronted on these issues. </li>

<p>Look at this Reddit post, which seems to be from former Reddit CEO Yishan Wong.I get the real feeling that Reddit is falling apart at the seams, and I'm not sure it will be able to recover.<br /><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3dautm/content_policy_update_ama_thursday_july_16th_1pm/ct3n7hc">https:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>www.reddit.com/<wbr></wbr>r/<wbr></wbr>announcements/<wbr></wbr>comments/<wbr></wbr>3dautm/<wbr></wbr>content_policy_update_ama_thursday_july_16th_1pm/<wbr></wbr>ct3n7hc</a></p>

<p>Ellen was more or less inclined to continue upholding my free-speech policies. /r/fatpeoplehate was banned for inciting off-site harassment, not discussing fat-shaming. What all the white-power racist-sexist neckbeards don't understand is that with her at the head of the company, the company would be immune to accusations of promoting sexism and racism: she is literally Silicon Valley's #1 Feminist Hero, so any "SJWs" would have a hard time attacking the company for intentionally creating a bastion (heh) of sexist/racist content. She probably would have tolerated your existence so long as you didn't cause any problems - I know that her long-term strategies were to find ways to surface and publicize reddit's good parts - allowing the bad parts to exist but keeping them out of the spotlight. It would have been very principled - the CEO of reddit, who once sued her previous employer for sexual discrimination, upholds free speech and tolerates the ugly side of humanity because it is so important to maintaining a platform for open discourse. It would have been unassailable.<br />Well, now she's gone (you did it reddit!), and /u/spez has the moral authority as a co-founder to move ahead with the purge. We tried to let you govern yourselves and you failed, so now The Man is going to set some Rules. Admittedly, I can't say I'm terribly upset.</p>

      <title>On Chipotle Price Increases</title>
      <link>http://www.theojones.name/2015/on-chipotle-price-increases</link>
      <guid>http://www.theojones.name/2015/on-chipotle-price-increases</guid>
      <pubDate>Wed, 15 Jul 2015 03:57:07 +0000</pubDate>
      <author>Theo Jones</author>
      <description><![CDATA[<div>
        
<p>The following article price increases in San Francisco by food chain Chipotle has gone viral, Huffington Post linked to it, and I've seen it on Facebook and quite a few other social media sources I use.<br /><a href="http://www.takepart.com/article/2015/07/12/chipotle-minimum-wage?cmpid=tp-ptnr-huffpost">http:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>www.takepart.com/<wbr></wbr>article/<wbr></wbr>2015/<wbr></wbr>07/<wbr></wbr>12/<wbr></wbr>chipotle-minimum-wage?cmpid=tp-ptnr-huffpost</a><br />In this post I'll do an analysis of where this article goes wrong. Let's first jump to the fairly idiotic section towards the middle of the article.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But before conservative economists use the beloved chain—which has ditched GMOs and is working toward preservative-free tortillas—</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are two quite stupid things with this line. The first is that the article offers seems to think that GMOs and preservatives are somehow relevant to the discussion of minimum wages. But even more seriously, is the fairly inane idea that appears all throughout this article that an increase in the minimum wage will have no effect on prices. Since labor costs are quite a substantial factor in overall business costs, increase in those costs have a fairly direct impact on prices. As far as I know, this is not reasonably disputed by any economist conservative or liberal. Pretty much the entire academic debate on minimum wage policy involves auxiliary effects of minimum wages such as effects on the overall employment level. You will see in the next quote that the article authors' understanding of what those effects on the price level might be definitely confused at best. And at the worst totally nonsensical.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So, Why Should You Care? One of the common arguments against raising the minimum wage is tied to price increases for consumers. If this cyclical effect were to take place in every industry, the result would be pure inflation. That has critics asking, what good is making a dollar more for minimum wage workers if every purchase also costs a dollar more?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This at once is  a severe understanding of what pretty much a reasonable economic model on the subject says, and probably a total misunderstanding of what the "critics" actually believe. Of course, it won't be purely inflationary. In the worst case, where there  is perfect pass through from the company to consumers. What will happen will be an up tick in prices that will mostly wind up in the income of the workers. It will not be purely inflationary in the nonsensical way described in the article because the percentage increase in the wages will exceed the increase in the price level caused by the wage increase. And even though the article author suggests otherwise, I don't see any reasonable way in which there can be no price increase.</p>
