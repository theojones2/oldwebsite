<p>Look at this Reddit post, which seems to be from former Reddit CEO Yishan Wong.I get the real feeling that Reddit is falling apart at the seams, and I'm not sure it will be able to recover.<br /><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3dautm/content_policy_update_ama_thursday_july_16th_1pm/ct3n7hc">https:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>www.reddit.com/<wbr></wbr>r/<wbr></wbr>announcements/<wbr></wbr>comments/<wbr></wbr>3dautm/<wbr></wbr>content_policy_update_ama_thursday_july_16th_1pm/<wbr></wbr>ct3n7hc</a></p>

<p>Ellen was more or less inclined to continue upholding my free-speech policies. /r/fatpeoplehate was banned for inciting off-site harassment, not discussing fat-shaming. What all the white-power racist-sexist neckbeards don't understand is that with her at the head of the company, the company would be immune to accusations of promoting sexism and racism: she is literally Silicon Valley's #1 Feminist Hero, so any "SJWs" would have a hard time attacking the company for intentionally creating a bastion (heh) of sexist/racist content. She probably would have tolerated your existence so long as you didn't cause any problems - I know that her long-term strategies were to find ways to surface and publicize reddit's good parts - allowing the bad parts to exist but keeping them out of the spotlight. It would have been very principled - the CEO of reddit, who once sued her previous employer for sexual discrimination, upholds free speech and tolerates the ugly side of humanity because it is so important to maintaining a platform for open discourse. It would have been unassailable.<br />Well, now she's gone (you did it reddit!), and /u/spez has the moral authority as a co-founder to move ahead with the purge. We tried to let you govern yourselves and you failed, so now The Man is going to set some Rules. Admittedly, I can't say I'm terribly upset.</p>

<p>The following article price increases in San Francisco by food chain Chipotle has gone viral, Huffington Post linked to it, and I've seen it on Facebook and quite a few other social media sources I use.<br /><a href="http://www.takepart.com/article/2015/07/12/chipotle-minimum-wage?cmpid=tp-ptnr-huffpost">http:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>www.takepart.com/<wbr></wbr>article/<wbr></wbr>2015/<wbr></wbr>07/<wbr></wbr>12/<wbr></wbr>chipotle-minimum-wage?cmpid=tp-ptnr-huffpost</a><br />In this post I'll do an analysis of where this article goes wrong. Let's first jump to the fairly idiotic section towards the middle of the article.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But before conservative economists use the beloved chain—which has ditched GMOs and is working toward preservative-free tortillas—</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are two quite stupid things with this line. The first is that the article offers seems to think that GMOs and preservatives are somehow relevant to the discussion of minimum wages. But even more seriously, is the fairly inane idea that appears all throughout this article that an increase in the minimum wage will have no effect on prices. Since labor costs are quite a substantial factor in overall business costs, increase in those costs have a fairly direct impact on prices. As far as I know, this is not reasonably disputed by any economist conservative or liberal. Pretty much the entire academic debate on minimum wage policy involves auxiliary effects of minimum wages such as effects on the overall employment level. You will see in the next quote that the article authors' understanding of what those effects on the price level might be definitely confused at best. And at the worst totally nonsensical.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So, Why Should You Care? One of the common arguments against raising the minimum wage is tied to price increases for consumers. If this cyclical effect were to take place in every industry, the result would be pure inflation. That has critics asking, what good is making a dollar more for minimum wage workers if every purchase also costs a dollar more?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This at once is  a severe understanding of what pretty much a reasonable economic model on the subject says, and probably a total misunderstanding of what the "critics" actually believe. Of course, it won't be purely inflationary. In the worst case, where there  is perfect pass through from the company to consumers. What will happen will be an up tick in prices that will mostly wind up in the income of the workers. It will not be purely inflationary in the nonsensical way described in the article because the percentage increase in the wages will exceed the increase in the price level caused by the wage increase. And even though the article author suggests otherwise, I don't see any reasonable way in which there can be no price increase.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The syllabus for the course has been posted online, and it reads a bit like a bad blog post. "Quantum physics is a branch of physics that understands the interrelationship between matter and energy," It states. "This science offers clear explanations as to why homeopathic remedies with seemingly no chemical trace of the original substance are able to resolve chronic diseases, why acupuncture can offer patients enough pain relief to undergo surgery without anesthesia, why meditation alone can, in some instances, reduce the size of cancerous tumors."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the type of crap I've seen a lot. There is Deepack Chopra and his ilk. Quantum gobbledygook is about the only justification for water memory I have heard other than total evasion of the issue. At the very least a lot of the homeopathic types also believe in quantum woo.</p>

<p>The really crappy thing with this is that is that it is under a natural sciences department. I've seen crap like this leak into social science classes. I've even had the misfortune of taking a class that somehow got into the Womens' studies department (taken for distribution requirements) with cross listing with other social science departments with a textbook that talked about how alternative medicine and homeopathy are perfectively good "ways of knowing" on par with "western medicine", and then went on to talk about the health risks of living near a power-line EMF field.</p>

<p>But this is the first I have seen from a department that should know better. At least its not from my university.</p>

<p>On a side note, I have a funny homeopathic story. I beekeep. One friend of mine heard this and insisted that a homeopathic dilution of bee alarm pheromone would work to calm bees in lue of smoke. All you have to do is spray the homeopathic remedy on the bees with a spray bottle. I am not making that up. It almost made me want to spray water on the bees to see what would happen, but I didn't do that because it is likely that the bees wouldn't be happy about it.</p>

<p>What are the values that have made America and Americans different? An American can be of any race, creed, religion, philosophy, or ethnicity. The United States has never been a country of one religious or ethnic group, and Americans have many diverse political philosophies. The ideal of America has been that of a country where immigrants from throughout the world could come and make a good life and where Americans from all socioeconomic backgrounds could move up the economic ladder, or at the least attain a good education and provide for themselves and their families if they work hard. America has always been a melting pot and a nation of diversity. America is a home for persons of all types­­ there is no one stereotypical real American.</p>

<p>Americans enjoy freedom of speech and religion and live under a legal system that protects these basic individual rights. What makes a real American is the strong belief in these values and the freedoms that come with being a citizen of the United States, as well as respect for those values and freedoms. The United States was founded to be a country where the most famous lines of the Declaration of Independence -- a document ratified 237 years ago today -- ring true, where “<em>We hold these truths to be self­ evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.</em>”</p>

<p>America was founded to be a nation of laws, not men, where there would never be a European­style aristocracy and where all were equal in rights and opportunity. These values are inherently both communal and individual as both liberty and equality involve the relations between individuals to other individuals in society. Because of this, the power of community has been at the heart of what makes America great. While these values and hopes have never been fully implemented, and there are still great inequities in American society, these values form the heart and soul of America and its people.</p>

<p>The fact that America is a nation of diversity can be seen in where Americans have come from. There have been Americans that have come from almost all cultural groups in the world.</p>

<p>Starting even before independence, America has been a melting pot of immigrants of different cultures and religions. British Puritans and Pilgrims migrated to the New World for religious liberty and settled in New England and founded the colonies of Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Connecticut. Quaker immigrants settled Pennsylvania looking for religious freedom. Pennsylvania after Quaker settlement was the first colony to provide religious freedom to all and soon became home to individuals of many religions. The Dutch founded what is now New York City, but this land was eventually absorbed into the British Empire. New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Delaware attracted many Irish, German and Scandinavian immigrants. By 1790 almost one half of the American population was not of British ancestry. Restrictions on immigration and importation of goods imposed by the British were a significant cause of the American Revolution. One of the grievances against the British monarch stated in the Declaration of Independence is that “<em>He has endeavored to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither</em>... “</p>

<p>After independence, the United States immigration laws were extremely permissive. The Naturalization Act of 1790, which was the first U. S. immigration law, placed no restrictions on immigration and allowed free whites to obtain citizenship after two years of residency in the United States. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, the United States had a free migration policy and had massive flows of immigrants from European nations, such as Ireland, and immigrants from Asia. This migration was its strongest around the time of the Irish Potato Famine. The inscription on the Statue of Liberty greeted the immigrants entering the country through Ellis Island with the following poem written by Emma Lazarus and titled The New Colossus. It summed up America's values toward immigrants,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame, With conquering limbs astride from land to land; Here at our sea­washed, sunset gates shall stand A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name Mother of Exiles. From her beacon­ hand Glows world­ wide welcome; her mild eyes command The air-­bridged harbor that twin cities frame. 'Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!' cries she With silent lips. 'Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest ­tossed to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!'”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>America was open to immigrants throughout the world and was a nation of opportunities. It is clear that this history has made the United States a nation of diversity created by immigrants from all over the world. This American history of immigration is what makes being American not about what religious or ethnic group you are part of, but about the American values of liberty and equality that are so eloquently summed up by The New Colossus. American values have always been to create a nation where people from throughout the world could come to experience liberty and opportunity. What makes an American is therefore belief in these values, the values that have attracted and brought so many immigrants to the United States.</p>

<p>The core values of America that shape and created the nation are liberty and equality. These values have drawn immigrants to the nation since the Puritans, Pilgrims and Quakers first set foot in the New World looking for religious liberty. It is these values that define what being an American is and form the basis of the American community. America was founded to be a place where no king could arbitrarily interfere with basic liberties. Freedom and equality come hand in hand and cannot exist without each other.</p>

<p>Freedom in the American community means not being dominated over, and living in a community with other citizens that are equal in rights and opportunities. American poet and author Walt Whitman defined freedom as follows, “<em>Freedom --­ to walk free and own no superior.</em>“ and said this of being a citizen of America, “<em>Neither a servant nor a master am I</em>.” These values have motivated American activists throughout the nation's history to fight for what is right and to fight to bring liberty and equal opportunity to all.</p>

<p>The founders of the United States saw freedom and equality as inherently linked. Excessive inequality could result in aristocracy and would be corrosive to society and freedom. But freedom was inherently linked with accepting that all men are created equal. Alexis de Tocqueville, a famous French author who wrote about the early United States, said, “<em>Grant me thirty years of equal division of inheritances and a free press, and I will provide you with a republic.</em>” In the Federalist #10, James Madison stated that “<em>the most common and durable source of factions has been the various and unequal distribution of property. Those who hold and those who are without property have ever formed distinct interests in society.</em>”</p>

<p>The struggle for freedom and equality for all has defined the United States throughout its history and defines what it means to be an American. The biggest questions in American history have been “what is liberty?” and “what is the proper relation between liberty and order?” and the biggest struggles in American history have involved expanding freedom and equality. The greatest victories in these struggles have come in four waves. The first wave of this struggle came with the Revolutionary War and the formation of the new United States government. The second wave of the American struggle for freedom for all came with the U.S Civil War and its aftermath. The third wave of this struggle came with the Great Depression, the New Deal and the Second World War and its aftermath. The fourth wave was the Civil Rights Movement. The Declaration of Independence was the statement of the core values of America and its people. However, the realization that “<em>all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights</em>” came throughout the history of the United States and is still not entirely complete. The Declaration of Independence stated that the role of government ought to be to protect these rights and that a just government is based around the consent of the governed. After independence, American society became the closest in existence to a society without an aristocracy. A government was created that was the closest thing to a republic of laws, not men, that existed in the world. About a decade after the end of the revolution, a constitution was ratified that created a new national government for the United States. In its Preamble the Constitution stated its purpose as follows, “<em>to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity.</em>” Shortly thereafter, a second great American document was created, the Bill of Rights. This document protected many fundamental rights from government violation. Through many years of existence and legal interpretation, the Bill of Rights became a great American document that has played a large role in determining the nature of American freedom and liberty and has been at the heart of the shared American historical and cultural heritage. These documents are part of what makes America what it is and Americans who they are.</p>

<p>The history of the Civil War and reconstruction resulted in a great expansion of liberty, the end of slavery, and the expansion of the rights of citizenship to many Americans who did not receive those liberties before. The legal changes that happened during this period are most dramatically reflected in the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, which reads in part, “<em>No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.</em>” The 14th Amendment's declaration that all are equal before the law put the Declaration of Independence's most famous value into the constitution. It stated that all Americans have rights that must be protected by law. Furthermore, the Civil War and its aftermath helped define what it means to be American by creating an American national identity. Americans were Americans first and foremost instead of residents of their states first and foremost.</p>

<p>The New Deal era and the aftermath of World War II brought a new era in the expansion of rights in the United States. During the New Deal, it was realized that liberty included certain economic rights and that protecting the liberty of the population included giving everyone economic opportunities. In a tradition that went back to the nation's founding, it was realized that excessive concentrations of wealth were harmful and made it difficult to maintain the conditions needed for freedom to continue. The Second World War and its aftermath saw the exportation of the American values of freedom for all to the rest of the world. During the war, President Franklin D. Roosevelt made his Four Freedoms speech in which he stated that freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom from fear, and freedom from want were human rights that ought to be protected for all persons everywhere in the world. This speech served to be an inspiration for the development of the United Nations after the war, and the expansion of human rights to everyone throughout the world. The civil rights movement that started in the 1950s expanded the horizons of American liberty and freedom. The formal racial segregation and discrimination of the Jim Crow era was ended and economic discrimination was reduced. Courts made important civil rights and civil liberties decisions that expanded liberty and equality for all. Economic programs such Lyndon Johnson's Great Society expanded opportunity and alleviated poverty. During the 1970s and 80s women's rights were established and expanded., in a large part due to court victories won by activists.</p>

<p>America is a nation of diversity created by a history of immigration, a nation not made of any one cultural or religious group. This nation has been a place where people of all kinds came for a better life throughout its entire history. This has been true since even before U.S independence. From Quaker and Puritan immigrants looking for religious freedom, to the immigrants of Ellis Island to modern immigrants, people have come to America looking for freedom. America has been a nation of ideals and laws, not of men or aristocracy, throughout its history. These values of freedom and equality have inspired struggle for all of America's history. While these struggles have never created a perfect union, America has become more perfect and a greater home to the blessings of liberty over its history. What makes a real American is not simply who you are, but it is our shared values and the belief that you have the freedom and opportunity to become all that you want to be, as long as you don't violate the freedoms and liberties of others. It is this belief in liberty and equality for all that makes America great and makes being an American great. The constitution gives Americans certain rights and our freedom and liberty are guaranteed. But what makes an American a real American is the respect for these values and the respect for the struggle that secured these freedoms, as well as a determination to continue to protect and fight for these values.</p>

<p>On reddit there is a crisis after the employee responsible for managing the site's famed Ask Me Anything <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/3bxduw/why_was_riama_along_with_a_number_of_other_large/">discussions was fired</a>.<br />A "friend" on facebook linked to this image. I'm not sure its true, but its the most plausible theory I've heard. It claims that she was fired because she would no go along with reddit's plan to "monetize" AMAs <br /><a href="wp-content/uploads/2015/07/CI9iYW7VAAAzzJN.png.html"><img src="wp-content/uploads/2015/07/CI9iYW7VAAAzzJN-263x300.png.html" alt="CI9iYW7VAAAzzJN" width="263" height="300" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2581"></a></p>

<p>Reddit CEO Ellen Pao, denies this story. But due to recent actions, he credibility is trashed. I wouldn't say she is clearly lying, just that her past actions leave her with almost no credibility in my opinion. Her previous management decisions in reddit have been idiotic, she was caught in a number of lies during the discrimination trial (at Kliner Perkins), and she had finical ties to her husband's near-Ponzi scheme (and I would strongly suspect, but can't prove, knowledge of its workings. It <em>IS </em>her husband and one does not let one's spouse spend millions in joint accets without some knowledge of what is happening). I want external confirmation for pretty much every non-obvious statement she makes at this point.</p>

<p>A number of sub reddits (including many of the most popular ones on the site) have shut down.</p>

<p>Allegations have surfaced that a different employee was fired due to his lukimia. See that employee's statement (which was later taken down by reddit here  <a href="https://archive.is/gcT8X">https:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>archive.is/<wbr></wbr>gcT8X</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was only until recently, late 2014, that I was able to return to work (remotely). Unfortunately due to new practices at reddit, all of the working employees were mandated to work from San Francisco, so I wasn’t actually able to work until I was ready to move. In January of 2015, I was almost ready to move to reddit. I had even flown out to SF for a few days while all of the reddit employees met during a company-wide 3-day seminar. </p>

<p>During this time, I had sat down with Ellen Pao (current reddit CEO) to discuss my future at reddit and when I was able to move. I had told her that it would still be at least a month (but probably closer to 2 or 3) before I was finally able to move to SF, and she said she was 100% fine with that. We discussed my position, and ultimately determined that I would be returning to the Community Management team. I met some of the new members of the team, all was well, and then I flew home on day 3.</p>

<p>Less than a month later, in February of 2015, I received a call from Ellen stating that I was to be terminated in less than a week. When I asked what the specific reason was, she had roughly stated that “because of our discussion, you are too sick to properly fulfill your duties as Community Manager.” (At no point during our meeting was this stated - I had raised concerns about the stress levels of Community Management, but had ultimately decided that it was something I could easily manage.) </p>

<p>I pleaded with Ellen to let me stay, as I had been sick for over a full year now and the only thing that was on my mind was coming back to work - work I loved so very, very much. She finally stated that if I were to get permission from my doctor stating that it was okay for me to move to SF and begin work, that I would be able to come back.</p>

<p>If that is true, reddit is going to be in a world of legal hurt. The situation with the leukemia patient sounds like a blatant violation of the ADA. And it sounds like there is written documentation and witnesses. Veronica could probably front enough of a gender discrimination case to get through to discovery, and bring forth some fairly damaging stuff. And I wonder if some the attempts of reddit to suppress discussion of this will cause them trouble under the National Labor Relations Act (which protects employee discussion of working conditions)? There are some rumors that Reddit has used the NDA in their employment contract to dissuade former employees from going to the press.</p>

            </h2>
                    <p class="reading">
                <span class="vague">3 min read </span>
            </p>
            
<p>I'm of the opinion that an advertisement-driven business model is inherently toxic for web media companies. I've seen a number of websites go downhill after they moved away from subscriptions and towards ads. <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/3bxduw/why_was_riama_along_with_a_number_of_other_large/">Reddit's issues</a> come out of an attempt to monetize the site. Ads make the users the product, cause the company to prefer over-all traffic over quality of content, and force the company to target the types of users that are the most subject to monetization (even if it means driving away other users, as a non-monetized user is worthless to you).  They drive the kind of clickbait trash that infests the likes of Buzzfeed, Outbrain, and Tabula. This is the type of stuff that is mocked by <em>The Onion's</em> <a href="http://www.clickhole.com/about">Clickhole</a> spinoff.</p>

<p>I say "web media companies" for a reason. The limitations of the print medium make a mostly-ad business model very difficult to pull off. Printing costs a lot more than web hosting. The print medium also makes the equivalent to clickbait much harder to pull off. There is no print equivalent to Outbrain that can teleport you an additional issue of the <em>Clickbait Daily</em> at will.  Users must to some degree seek out the publication and value its reputation.</p>

<p>Traffic seeking is a problem driven by advertising. Ads pay in proportion to traffic, not quality of content. They demand users, and users that click. In an ad driven world, writing becomes a world of obtaining clicks and reselling them. The obtaining clicks is often conducted through social media, and places like Outbrain, as google has cracked down on blatant clickbait and trash content through efforts such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Penguin">Penguin </a>and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Panda">Panda</a> adjustments to their ranking method, and <a href="http://www.fastcolabs.com/3015422/why-is-google-highligting-long-form-articles">through favoring longer articles</a> over shorter ones.</p>

<p>The alternatives to ads are a subscription model, the shareware/soft paywall model,  a product selling model, or the Wikipedia . In a subscription model the website charges its users. The traditional way to do this is through a paywall. Users get a few free articles, and then get cut off until they subscribe.  An even better alternative would be a shareware model. This is anaglious to the "shareware" software of old, which contained a nag screen for payment. Replace ads with a nag for subscription. This is what I think could work for a lot of sites. Some sites may also be able to sell secondary products, like books, and the like. However, I think this has some difficulties for most sites, particularly as the market for products of that kind tends to be limited. And then there is the Wikipedia model, of volunteer labor for content production. The limitations of such a method are obvious. But it works for even some very large websites.</p>

<p>The above said, I am not saying that ads have no place in the world of the web. They can be a good secondary source of revenue.  But, I am saying that reputable publications should not use them as their primary form of website monetization. An ad-driven revenue stream produces toxic incentives for website owners.</p>
