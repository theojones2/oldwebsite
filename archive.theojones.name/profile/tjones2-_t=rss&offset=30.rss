    <blockquote><p>"I’ve talked and written before about how I strive to be as paperless as possible. I get documents electronically whenever possible. Bills, receipts, and much more come to me in the form of bits rather than on sheets of paper. One of the biggest reasons I do this is that I can do something with bits much more easily than I can with paper: I can back them up. With paper, unless you burn more paper with a copy machine, you have exactly and only one copy. With electronic documents, you can have as many copies as you care to create. I think for most of my electronic documents, about half a dozen machines in something like three or four states would all have to implode simultaneously for me to actually lose something – and those include not just my machines but some that are owned by some pretty large companies. So, what do I do when I actually get paper? Needless to say, I scan it, but it’s how I scan and how I manage my documents after that where things get kind of interesting."</p></blockquote></div>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="known-bookmark">
    <blockquote><p>"So I think my case is made. Organic agriculture is significantly less efficient in land-use terms than conventional. (And the picture could be even worse than -34% in comparative terms, given that indirect land use was not taken into account in the Nature study.) On the other hand, there is no compelling scientific evidence that GM crops are in any way more dangerous than their conventional alternatives, and therefore they do not require labelling."</p></blockquote></div>

    <blockquote><p>" recently heard from someone that they had essentially done the opposite of going paperless. They'd reverted from digital tools and gone back to paper for most of their tasks. Needless to say, I had something to say on the topic. Smile I think that there are some serious advantages to going digital if it's done properly. In fact, I'll give you three very specific reasons why digital is better than paper in many (if not most) situations. The first one is, to me, so compelling that it alone would be enough. (And if you're a regular reader, you'll recognize it immediately.) I'll also discuss some situations where paper really is better."</p></blockquote></div>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="known-bookmark">
    
<p>"The most important element in the social structure of Kim Il Sung’s North Korea was the infamous songbun system. This system was established in the late 1950s and came into full power somewhere around 1967. It divides the population into groups, according to the actions and status of their paternal ancestor (and themselves, depending on their age) during the Japanese colonial period and the Korean War. Songbun determined, among other things, whether one was allowed to live in the capital or in special cities like Kaesong and later Rason, the workplace one is allocated and what kind of education one can receive."</p>

      <title>Jon Ronson&#x2019;s So You&#x2019;ve Been Publicly Shamed, reviewed.</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="known-bookmark">
    
<p>"I wish that Ronson had also considered why demanding that someone is fired from his or her job has become so central to the public shaming ritual. This demand, I think, reveals several things. First, it reflects how we are all public figures now and all have brands or reputations to protect, and so do our erstwhile employers. We have ported the logic of the celebrity shame cycle—in which corporate sponsors are expected to drop the offender posthaste—to the workaday world. It’s a strange conflation of the public and private, of believing that individuals are always-on representatives of their employers and that an incensed public is in a position to decide when this association should end."</p>
