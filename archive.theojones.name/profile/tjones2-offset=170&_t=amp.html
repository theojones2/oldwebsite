<p>Milton Friedman discussing the possibility of a basic income/negative income tax in 1968. Don't you wish conservatives were still like this instead of like Rush Limbaugh? Probably, part of the reason why Friedman supported this is because, adopting a basic income will allow government policy that is in most other aspects much more libertarian.<br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtpgkX588nM">https:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>www.youtube.com/<wbr></wbr>watch?v=xtpgkX588nM</a></p>

<p>I've hinted this before in previous postings of mine about health care, but the way to resolve a lot of the tension between fee for service health care pricing, and fixed rate pricing is to reimburse doctors like in fixed rate pricing to avoid toxic incentives on the provider end. But use (government) administered prices to manage demand on the consumer side and to prevent wasteful usage of health services. Straight up fee for service won't work because that would give providers intensive to over-treat due to imperfect information. But you still want to put some price signals on consumers. Its like the "market socialism" proposals to introduce pseudo-prices into planned economies to avoid shortage.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> The extent to which land use is an important factor in environmental policy is heavily unappreciated. It is as likely to be a major future environmental issue and is likely to be as destructive as other major issues, like climate change. Major developed countries of the world are on a massively unsustainable track of their land use regards to agriculture and other major sources of land use. Major adjustments in these economies will have to be made sooner or later. There is simply not enough land available on earth to sustain the current consumption patterns of the typical American, or the typical Western European. What cannot continue will not continue. Things will have to change one way or another. The question in regards to land use is, the choice over if consumption will be changed in response to a very rapid crisis, or it will be changed gradually time to adjust to new conditions. And in the meantime, the large-scale overconsumption of land based resources results in major economic distortions, and causes critical resources like food to be overpriced for the rest of the world. Overconsumption of land produced resources also causes severe environmental damage such as species loss, deforestation, loss of culturally valuable natural sites, and feedbacks that result in increased climate change and other forms of pollution. But things like forests and fisheries, and other naturally bioproductive areas can be depleted in a way that damages their future production. We do not want to be in the situation where we have depleted a resource that will take generations to rebuild. And with things like species loss, once the environmental damage has been done it is impossible to repair. This is why action must be taken before there is a crisis. We must conserve our land resources. Energy is also another issue where land use plays a particularly unappreciated role. Most people take "sustainable energy" as meaning something largely synonymous with "does not emit CO2 pollution". However, this is necessary but not sufficient part of sustainable energy. There are plenty of energy sources that serve to seriously worsen the land use issue, even though they are nominally carbon neutral. <a href="../why-biofuels-will-never-amount-to-a-substantial-proportion-of-future-world-energy-use/index.html">As I discussed in yesterday's post on this blog</a>, biofuels are a particularly severe case of this. The land use issue is a major factor in why I am under the belief that the most sustainable energy source that can be deployed with current technology is nuclear energy, as it uses very little land.<br /></span> </p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I am strongly against the wider deployment of biofuels. There are the obvious interactions between biofuel production and food prices, and biofuel production is largely responsible for the 2007 price crisis. Other than the large-scale humanitarian reasons to oppose biofuel production as a serious alternative energy, there is also the fact that even considering very generous projections, the fuel source is unlikely to ever produce a large amount of the world's energy supply. Compared to the land they take up, plants are just extremely efficient energy producers. This blog post will show how is simply not possible with anything like current technology to meet even a substantial amount of the world's energy needs with biofuels. I will start with a generous estimate of the maximum possible biomass energy production come out of agricultural land. First are some quick assumptions. The first is that world's future energy supply will need to provide a developed nation level of energy use to a population of about 9 billion people. Furthermore, this will at the very least require power production amounting to about 5000 W per person on average. The current US power consumption amounts to about 10,000 W on average. Now let's calculate based on highly favorable assumptions how much of the world's energy supply biomass energy could reasonably provide.<br /></span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Let's first start the total surface area of the Earth, <a href="http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhypertextbook.com%2Ffacts%2F2001%2FDanielChen.shtml&amp;date=2015-05-24">which is about 361,800,000 square kilometers</a>. How much of this is reasonably available to agriculture? Only 150,000,000 square kilometers is land and only some of this land is actually useful for agriculture. So when you adjust you get a total useful percentage of the Earth's land surface area of <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v461/n7263/full/461472a.html">about 15%</a>. Now, that estimate, would result in estimate of global available crop land of substantially less than half a hectare, or about 1 acre of cropland per person. However, that estimate is based on many environmental constraints. Let's ignore them. The purpose of this article let's pretend we want to maximize biofuel production regardless of any environmental constraints, even if it means destroying almost every natural ecosystem around. Let's pave over every roughly arable plot of land. When you subtract out on the uninhabitable land or land is otherwise useless to large-scale agriculture and divide by the future expected population of 9 billion, <a href="http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.zo.utexas.edu%2Fcourses%2FTHOC%2Fland.html&amp;date=2015-05-25">you get an area of about one hectare (~2 acres) of land per person</a>. If all this land were converted to biofuel production, how much energy could it produce? Of course, this will be a highly generous estimate. One hectare is 10,000 square meters. How much energy do biofuel crops produced per square meter? Depends on the crop. <a href="http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.withouthotair.com%2FcD%2Fpage_284.shtml&amp;date=2015-05-25">Corn grown in the United States converted to ethanol produces about 0.02 watts of energy per square meter</a>. When scaled up across the per-person hectare, this amounts to about 200W per person. This is a straight up puny amount of energy production compared to the total world needs. What about improved technology? The previous link suggests that theoretical cellulosic ethanol system could deliver about 0.2 watts per square meter. This gives a somewhat reasonable contribution to overall energy production. However, such a large number as a product of a very generous estimate, and predicts some technology that only exists on paper. And remember, that per person amount is based on an assumption where all reasonably useful land is being devoted voted to the purpose. Already, most reasonably usable agricultural land is already being used for food production. From page 21 of<br /></span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 36pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong><em>About 12 % of the global land surface is currently under crop cultivation (Foley et al., 2005; Ramankutty et al. 2008). The allowed 3 % expansion (approximately 400 Mha) to the level we propose as a land system boundary will most likely be reached over the coming decades,and includes suitable land that is not either currently cultivated or is under forest cover – e.g., abandoned cropland in Europe, North America and the former Soviet Union and some areas of Africa's savannas and South America's cerrado
</em></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Overall, is clear that, at least with current technology biofuels will be extremely unlikely to provide a substantial contribution to the overall substantial energy production. The current programs of subsidies for biofuel production should be immediately phased out. It will be extremely unlikely to contribute to a substantial energy future. In the meantime, biofuel production will compete with food production while producing very little economic value. Because of this competition with food production and because of the tendencies for this competition increase prices and inflation, I furthermore think that even privately funded biofuel production should be outlawed on any commercial, near commercial, or industrial scale. The small scale production that does continue should be heavily regulated, should be forced to use feed stocks that have no risk of competition with food supplies, and should be heavily taxed (due to the imperfections of regulation in catching all unwanted use of the tech). </span></p>

<p>In my previous posts on the Indiana RFRA, I focused on some of the misconceptions going around about what the law actually is about. Now, with that issue cleared up, I will discuss why I think that the RFRA legislation is a bad idea. Now, there are some reasons why exempting people who disagree with a law from it whenever reasonably practical might seem attractive. However, I contend that the practical issues with such a rule end up making it fundamentally unworkable. Furthermore I have some more general conceptual issues the idea behind the law. My first objection to it, is about how the law favors religious objections to legislation over secular ones this is fundamentally unfair the nonreligious individuals who might have an objection to a law that does not involve religious belief. The second objection is to the legal standard the RFRA uses to evaluate potential requests for exemptions-taken at its face it's much too strong and lets in too many objections that interfere with the public purpose. The third objection is fundamentally the bureaucratic hassle involved in evaluating such requests even a more lax standard for evaluating objections to laws will require creating many special situations for people. This will bring the associated paperwork bureaucratic tangle that one would expect from such a situation. Finally, proposed ways to patch the law, such as ruling out the ability for corporate entities to claim exemptions (even when owned by individuals of uniform belief), will fundamentally not work to resolve the issues involved will bring their own issues. Now, I will say, this issue brings up complicated trade-offs inverse rest of this post I will try to give the opposing side its due, and I will look at some of their arguments. I hope you will find his explanation my opinion to be reasonably balanced and take opposing arguments is having some degree of credibility-even if I express fundamental disagreement.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>An editorial by Daniel O. Conkle published March 26 <a href="http://www.indystar.com/story/opinion/readers/2015/03/07/indiana-needs-religious-freedom-legislation/24477303/">defends the Indiana law on the grounds that it allows the protection</a> of "religious believers of all faiths by granting them precisely the same consideration [as the federal RFRA provides]. He notes that the level of scrutiny provided for in the law has served to provide some potentially useful protections of the rights of religious groups.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36pt;"><em>Applying this test, a unanimous U.S. Supreme Court recently ruled that a Muslim prisoner was free to practice his faith by wearing a half-inch beard that posed no risk to prison security. Likewise, in a 2012 decision, a court ruled that the Pennsylvania RFRA protected the outreach ministry of a group of Philadelphia churches, ruling that the city could not bar them from feeding homeless individuals in the city parks.
</em></p><p style="margin-left: 36pt;"><em>…..
</em></p><p style="margin-left: 36pt;"><em>In any event, most religious freedom claims have nothing to do with same-sex marriage or discrimination. The proposed Indiana RFRA would provide valuable guidance to Indiana courts, directing them to balance religious freedom against competing interests under the same legal standard that applies throughout most of the land.
</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/03/29/1374196/-The-Strange-Career-of-RFRA">A writer on the liberal website Daily Kos likewise says that</a> the history of the law comes from a strong intent to protect the rights of religious miniorities, and to defend separation of church and state. Treating the right to free exercise of religion as strongly as other rights furthers this goal in the author's opinion.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36pt;"><em>As long as laws were facially neutral, i.e., were not targeting or singling out particular religious groups for discrimination, then a law which indirectly restricted or burdened a religious practice was/is constitutional. Scalia replaced the Sherbet test of "compelling interest and strict scrutiny" with a "no coercion" test. If your religious practice is accidentally harmed by a facially neutral law that is not intended to coerce or punish your religious group, tough shit.</em>
<em>People were outraged and the outrage spanned the political spectrum of the early 1990s. Strict separation groups like the ACLU, Americans United, the BJCPA, and the People for the American Way made common cause with the Catholic Bishops, the American Jewish Congress, the Christian Legal Society (a very conservative group) and many others to craft the Religious Freedom Restoration Act which was designed to restore the strict scrutiny and compelling interest tests at the federal level
</em></p><p style="margin-left: 36pt;"><em>….
</em></p><p style="margin-left: 36pt;"><em>Without Sherbet [v. Verner – a case setting a similar standard to the one found in RFRAs], one gets a form of secular society more like France's (e.g. where one can ban wearing of religious symbols) than the "benevolent neutrality" that has always been the American tradition.
</em></p>
<p><a href="http://wthitv.com/2015/03/27/one-indiana-state-representative-sits-down-with-news-10-to-explain-his-vote-for-rfra/">A member of the Indiana legislature had the following to say in favor of the law</a>:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36pt;"><em>First and foremost, what does RFRA do? It establishes a judicial standard of review that will provide the courts with clear guidance on how to resolve any matters that come forth surrounding religious freedom. RFRA protects the rights of everyone, regardless of their religious affiliation or lack thereof. This bill is about prohibiting a governmental entity from substantially burdening a person's exercise of religion. It only applies to government action, not citizen to citizen.
</em></p><p style="margin-left: 36pt;"><em>A quick example, in 2012 a court determined that RFRA protected the outreach ministry of a group of Philadelphia churches, ruling that the city could not bar them from feeding homeless individuals. Along with practical examples, it is equally important to look at the history behind RFRA.
</em></p>
<p>However with the clear good at such laws have provided on some points there is substantial possibility for negative outcomes. And on its surface test the RFRA demands is exceedingly harsh. Probably legitimate claims such laws been known to bring in frivolous or at least highly dubious ones. The only reason we haven't seen the worst of what that standard truly means that courts have implicitly watered it down to a much more reasonable one. Doing so, courts have probably saved the legislature from itself. But, one should take a moment to think what the standard entailed by the plain language of RFRAs would entail if taken seriously. In <em>Employment Division v. Smith</em> (the case which RFRAs are primarily meant to reverse) the Court said the following:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36pt;"><em>The "compelling government interest" requirement seems benign, because it is familiar from other fields. But using it as the standard that must be met before the government may accord different treatment on the basis of race, see, e.g., Palmore v. Sidoti, or before the government may regulate the content of speech, see, e.g., Sable Communications of California v. FCC, is not remotely comparable to using it for the purpose asserted here. What it produces in those other fields -- equality of treatment, and an unrestricted flow of contending speech -- are constitutional norms; what it would produce here -- a private right to ignore generally applicable laws -- is a constitutional anomaly.
</em></p><p style="margin-left: 36pt;"><em>… The rule respondents favor would open the prospect of constitutionally required religious exemptions from civic obligations of almost every conceivable kind -- ranging from compulsory military service to the payment of taxes to health and safety regulation such as manslaughter and child neglect laws, compulsory vaccination laws, drug laws, and traffic laws; to social welfare legislation such as minimum wage laws, child labor laws, animal cruelty laws, environmental protection laws, and laws providing for equality of opportunity for the races.
</em></p>
<p>The only reason that the disaster posed in that opinion did not occur that the courts corrected for the flaw by, at least de facto, substituting the standard stated in the federal RFRA a much more lenient and reasonable one. As the RFRA has been applied, the strict scrutiny stated in the law, has been converted into something that looks a lot more like weaker standards like intermediate scrutiny. However, this workaround is not neutralized the threat that putting such a harsh standard the law poses. Strict scrutiny the legal standard used in a lot of areas; such as free speech law and privacy law. When courts out of necessity say something is the least restrictive means to meeting a compelling need in order to accommodate a malformed law passed by Congress, the application of that standard is undermined in all areas of law.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In my opinion, another critical flaw of RFRAs is that they favor religion over non-religion by allowing for exemptions based on religious grounds but not allowing for exemptions based on secular beliefs. I haven't been able to find the proponent of the law attempts to seriously justify this element of the law. It makes little sense to give a religious exemption, but not an exemption to someone who has a secular objection. In fact, I would argue that, if anything, it should be the secular exemptions to get degree of priority-as these tend to be the ones that have the highest chance based on some grounds that are widely justifiable and contestable based on shared values. Belief that comes from musings about what a sky fairy wants, have a much lower chance of being based on publicly contestable and justifiable values.</p>
<p>A common suggestion to fix some of the deficiencies of the law is to remove reginition of corporations as eligible for protection under RFRAs – with the argument that the problems come from applying it to businesses. The above mentioned Daily Kos article elaborates on this position</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36pt;"><em>In all this legal history, there is no mention of allowing businesses to discriminate on which customers to serve. There is no targeting of LGBTQ persons or Muslims or women trying to fill birth control prescriptions, etc. RFRA and its state counterparts were designed to stop a majoritarian minded SCOTUS and overreaching government from restricting religious practices--usually practices by minority groups overlooked by majorities. RFRA and its state clones were supposed to be protections for relatively powerless groups, not weapons by powerful groups against vulnerable individuals. So, what happened?
</em></p><p style="margin-left: 36pt;"><em>…..
</em></p><p style="margin-left: 36pt;"><em>The other start to this strange twist was Citizens United because, even though the case was about campaign finance regulations, the SCOTUS ruled that corporations are persons and entitled to free speech protection. Then the Hobby Lobby case extended this "logic" further, allowing a business to have a religious liberty claim--when never before in this country had "religious liberty" meant an employer's liberty to impose his/her religious convictions on employees (If my employer is a Jehovah's Witness, can s/he now deny blood transfusions in my health coverage because of his/her religious belief?) or customers.
</em></p>
<p>This point of view is pretty counterfactual as to the actual role of corporate personhood in the law. It is not something that originated with the citizens untied case, and goes as far back as the 1800s. Furthermore, not all of the issues with RFRAs, or even the most severe issues with the concept behind them come from its applications to businesses. As I explained to some degree in the last post on the RFRA, courts are pretty unlikely to apply it in a way that allows for discrimination. And even the Hobby Lobby case was not as huge a problem as it would seem at first glance. And the HL case isn't an example of it being a huge problem there was an easy workaround to that ruling. Funny accounting. And that is what the HHS eventually did to deal with the issue. But the HL case does illustrate the real issue with RFRAs -- that it will mandate special work abounds that consume a lot of administrative effort. HL got an arrangement where the insurance company uses non-HL money to pay for the birth control and uses HL money to pay for non-birth control treatment for other people than HL employees. Waste of time bullshit. And RFRAs are good at generating circumstances that require that type of pointless work around. But there isn't going to be any disastrous outcomes, just a large number of minor annoyances. The hugely problematic issues come from lone individuals. One of the precursors of the Indiana RFRA was a law providing for religious exemptions to vaccinations. Also inherent in this type of argument seems to be the thought that it is impossible for anyone with a problematic religious view to use a wide grant of exemption in an adverse way.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">Well, the Indiana RFRA (Religious Freedom Restoration Act) passed. The whole debate on that legislation could easily be summed up by the Internet meme that says "the amount of energy to refute bullshit is an order of magnitude to bigger then to produce it".</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><amp-img src="http://www.theojones.name/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/032915_0751_OntheRecent1.jpg" alt=""></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The bill provides that religious belief exempts one from regulations, even neutral ones, unless the government produces a compelling need. Neither the Indiana bill nor its federal twin are particular to any type of regulation – and don't mention anti-discrimination issues. Probably 90% of the arguments from both sides in this issue are blatant nonsense. From some Internet discussions you would think people are talking about a different law. The opposition side produces bleating about the law being "a right to discriminate" law. The description of what they mean often has as little to do with the actual legislation, as screeching about how Obama care brings death panels. Especially considering that none of the 19 states that have almost identical legislation have ever granted an exemption to an antidiscrimination law based on a RFRA. It is extremely unlikely that the law will affect anti-discrimination law in any meaningful way. The side in favor of the law usually isn't much better. These people seem to think that religious freedom is under imminent attack. And even worse are the outright homophobic bigots who see in this law a chance that they will be able to do what they want. I have seen very few people discussing this bill who have shown the slightest bit of understanding of it. And even fewer people who have read it. Some of the actual issues brought up by the bill (which for various reasons I strongly disagree with) found to what extent religious exemptions be given to neutral laws are rarely discussed in any coherent degree. The whole debate is dominated by pure bullshit. The whole debate is just nonsense, and people who seem to be immune to logical or rational argument arguing with each other. And with this type of issue anything resembling actual argument doesn't last long against the backdrop of screeching howler monkeys.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">There are a lot of reasons to oppose RFRAs, but as far as I can tell the gay-rights stuff and anti-discrimination law stuff has little to do with the actual law (<a href="https://iga.in.gov/static-documents/9/2/b/a/92bab197/SB0101.05.ENRS.pdf">go read it, a lot of the media coverage on the subject is pretty misleading about the actual content</a>) -- unless the interpretation of the Indiana law differs radically from the interpretation of nearly identical laws in both federal law and the RFRAs in about a dozen other states. And despite that RFRAs have been on the books for about 20 years, no-one has been able to produce a non-overturned case where a RFRA weakened anti-discrimination law. In fact, courts have generally ruled that anti-discrimination passes strict scrutiny, making RFRAs irrelevant. And where the hell did the conception of this bill as an anti-gay one even come from? I don't really know. I think at least some of the proponents are under the impression that it will allow for exemptions to anti-discrimination laws and support it in part for that reason. I think some of the rage came from that (is public accommodation discrimination against gays even a thing? I haven't heard many real cases of it happening). And then there was the Arizona RFRA-ish bill which was really a stealth discrimination bill. If anyone has a good explanation for that tell it to me. This legislation is likely not just a useless repetition of current law. It goes far beyond what the Constitution mandates and even with the federal RFRA, a state RFRA has some effect. In City of Boerne v. Flores the Supreme Court struck down the part of the federal RFRA that applies to the states. But panicking over a state RFRA is a bit too much because we have a decade's worth of litigation over its federal version and good caselaw on what it means.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Neither the Indiana bill nor its federal twin are particular to any type of regulation and include pretty much all of law. I don't think either the federal RFRA or its state versions are a good idea. The idea of religious exemptions from neutral laws is almost always a bad idea. But that isn't what the discussion of the law seems to be focusing on. As I said before<a href="https://iga.in.gov/static-documents/9/2/b/a/92bab197/SB0101.05.ENRS.pdf">, this is a good issue to actually read the bill on, and to read</a> (or at least Wikipedia) some of the relevant court opinions. The bill is only four generously spaced pages long. The religious should not be exempted from neutral laws on the basis of religious belief and I oppose it. The Supreme Court has made it pretty clear that that the First Amendment does not allow people to ignore neutral laws on the basis of religious belief (with a handful of exceptions). See, for example, <em>Employment Division v. Smith</em>. The goal of RFRAs is to override that ruling (the federal RFRA was actually spawned by that ruling) and make actions conducted as a product of religious belief protected. Now, I strongly believe that SCOTUS got it right in Smith, and that RFRAs are fundamentally a bad idea, but the final decision belongs with the legislative branch. Lets look at what the 11-section Indiana bill (which is likely to pass) actually says as I go through a brief summary</p><p style="text-align: justify;">•Section 1: Says that the bill applies to all government laws and regulations, even ones made prior to the enactment of it.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">•Section 2: Only regulations particularly exempted by law are exempt.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">•Section 3: Definitions. Says that regulators are not allowed to use unconstutional provisions to work around the bill with particular mention of the establishment clause of the first amendment.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">•Section 4: More definitions. Pretty obvious and straightforward stuff.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">•Section 5. Defines "exercise of religion" as "any exercise of religion, whether or not compelled by, or central to, a system of religious belief".</p><p style="text-align: justify;">•Section 6: Defines "government entity".</p><p style="text-align: justify;">•Section 7: Defines "Person", includes corporations, but so does the federal RFRA. This right here is a good point to emphasize quite a bit. On internet forms I've seen a number of people who seem to think one of the defining characteristics of this RFRA versus the federal version, or the version in other states, is corporate personhood. It is not true. Like most other federal laws the federal RFRA relies on the Dictionary Act for its definition of "person". The dictionary act quite explicitly defines person to include corporations. <a href="http://www.yalelawjournal.org/forum/hobby-lobby-and-the-dictionary-act">Courts have ruled that no other part of the law overrides that</a>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">•Section 8: States that a governmental entity may not substantially burden a person's exercise of religion unless it meets strict scrutiny. (it's worth noting that the way that courts have actually ruled in regards to RFRAs makes the standard a lot more like intermediate scrutiny).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">•Section 9: People can sue over violations of the law.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">•Section 10: Government agencies can be ordered to pay damages to those affected.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">•Section 11: The bill does not limit the actions of private actors, only government actions, laws and regulations.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Section 8 is the core of the bill and most of the definition sections are mostly boilerplate. Section 8 is almost word for word identical to its counterpart in the federal RFRA.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In a follow up post, I will discuss some reasons why it is a dubious idea to grant religious exemptions to neutral laws and then I will discuss why it is extremely unlikely that the RFRA will ever be interpited to allow for discrimination.</p><p><a href="../tag/dictionaryact.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#dictionaryact</a> <a href="../tag/firstamendment.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#firstamendment</a> <a href="../tag/politics.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#politics</a> <a href="../tag/rfra.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#rfra</a> <a href="../tag/scotus.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#scotus</a></p></div>                    </div>

<p><a href="http://www.culturalcognition.net/browse-papers/geoengineering-and-the-science-communication-environment-a-c.html">A new study published in <em>Annals of the AAPS</em> suggests</a>that providing information about the possibility of geoengineering might cause individuals to accept climate change. The authors speculate that it has to do with ideology -- conservatives (or hierarchical-individualists as the paper calls them) tend to put a lot of faith in business and industry, and a conventional presentation of the climate change issue tends to be at least somewhat in opposition to business. Geoengennering uses the tools of industry and thus it might be more palatable to conservatives. That line of reasoning makes me wonder if it was a mistake for activists to emphasize renewable energy as the main alternative to fossil fuels. Nuclear might be more favorable for conservatives. The abstract of the paper reads</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We conducted a two-nation study (United States, n = 1500; England, n = 1500) to test a novel theory of science communication. The cultural cognition thesis posits that individuals make extensive reliance on cultural meanings in forming perceptions of risk. The logic of the cultural cognition thesis suggests the potential value of a distinctive two-channel science communication strategy that combines information content (“Channel 1”) with cultural meanings (“Channel 2”) selected to promote open-minded assessment of information across diverse communities. In the study, scientific information content on climate change was held constant while the cultural meaning of that information was experimentally manipulated. Consistent with the study hypotheses, we found that making citizens aware of the potential contribution of geoengineering as a supplement to restriction of CO2 emissions helps to offset cultural polarization over the validity of climate-change science. We also tested the hypothesis, derived from competing models of science communication, that exposure to information on geoengineering would provoke discounting of climate-change risks generally. Contrary to this hypothesis, we found that subjects exposed to information about geoengineering were slightly more concerned about climate change risks than those assigned to a control condition.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.skepticalscience.com/kahan-geoeng-polar.html">SKS' Andy Skuce notes</a> that their framing of geoengineering is pretty slanted. The article presented to participants is the following.</p>

<p><a href="../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/kahangeo1.jpg.html"><amp-img class=" size-full wp-image-2120 alignnone" src="http://www.theojones.name/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/kahangeo1.jpg" alt="kahangeo1" width="545" height="702"></a></p>

<p>The techniques vary a lot, but I generally consider geoengineering better than just bearing the costs of severe climate change and adapting, but worse than actually preventing emissions. The other thing is that the most practical/cheapest geoengineering schemes tend to be the ones with the most adverse impacts. I also think that a geoengineering project will be deployed at some point, as I don't see a full mitigation of CO2 emissions happening anything soon with enough strength to avoid dangerous levels of climate change. The scale of the shift in energy infrastructure is on the scale of the investment that happened to fight world war II, and I see no indication that policy makers are willing to commit to that type of investment quickly enough to change things (even though they should).</p>
