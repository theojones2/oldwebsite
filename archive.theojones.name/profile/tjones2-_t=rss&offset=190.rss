<p>There have been a number of cases recently where bakeries have been sued for refusing to provide cakes adjusted for gay weddings (i.e with two male figurines, or with appropriate phrasing of text).   Recently <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/01/21/denver-bakery-anti-gay-cake-_n_6516674.html">there also was a mirror image case</a> wherein a bakery refused to letter a cake with a religious anti-gay message. There is a bit of a point to those who object to this type of complaint, the service like a bakery or the like young something that is art are very close to art. Artists can express in their work, it does some pretty gnarly issues with freedom of speech and censorship. However, there is also a need for universal access to business services. Decision has been something quite a bit conflicted about since I've heard about it in previous incidents where this type of issue has come up. And really it comes down to how much of an artistic expression is in the final work. Closer things get to pure are the strong degree of creativity more there is to problems of freedom of expression and censorship. Pretty much what I think is the cutoff should be at where there's a substantial amount of creativity added. Think enough added actual creativity for a new work the baker or whatever creates to be eligible for copyright. And what I've come to realize is that just transcribing some text given to you by a customer doesn't really add much creativity. That makes it so it's really the same product is the same cake only with a different text. Businesses should generally be obligated to serve everyone in the community.It was something else like an artist, or a photographer, or such I would still feel different. Fact that they are concerns over freedom of expression thoroughly dismissed in this issue is more concerning a lot of the discrimination is trying to be combated. In fact, I would say that this might be symptomatic in general a retreat by the left from freedom of speech and civil liberties. Because it is close to undeniable that the closer attempts to eliminate discrimination to work of artists creative workers the more the severe issues with reductions in freedoms caused by the regulations become. Policymakers and commentators should not ignore those issues. Like many issues in politics there are trade-offs involved between different freedoms, and those trade-offs need to be weighed fairly, not completely dismissed.</p>

<p><img align="right" src="http://www.theojones.name/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/012115_0533_Meetthe8cha12.jpg" alt=""><span style="font-size:14pt">8chan is a forum website where anyone can create a sub forum, or "chan". Its one defining  feature is its friendliness to trolls, and its extremely lax , anything goes moderation policy. Among the more notable members of this community are a large part of the active members of <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/GamerGate" class="p-category" rel="tag">#GamerGate</a>, focused around the /<a href="http://8ch.net/gamergate/index.html">gamergate</a>/ board. However, there is a much more nefarious board, /<a href="http://8ch.net/baphomet/index.html">baphomet</a>/. That board has the purpose of a clearing house for doxing, harassment, trolling, and hacking. Its members care little for trivial things like ethics. The rules for the board note that "If you have remorse for you're  [sic] actions you are not welcome ….We never show mercy during raids " and  "so if you're a attention whoring faggot this is not the place for you".  /Baphomet/ was founded by trolls and script kiddies saddened by the switch of focus of the hacking group Anonymous towards activism and away from nefarious destruction. Many members of the /gamergate/ chan are also /Baphomet/ users.  There is a close relationship between the two boards. /gamergate/ is the clean board that provides a respectiable public image for GG. /Baphomet/ has become the home for GG dirty tricks. Want to know what GG is really like? Lets  look into /baphomet/ a bit more <a href="http://8ch.net/baphomet/index.html"></a><a href="http://8ch.net/baphomet/index.html">http:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>8ch.net/<wbr></wbr>baphomet/<wbr></wbr>index.html</a> Note that /baphomet/ is just behind /gamergate/ on the top 25 list of 8chan fora. The top thread is this guy<br /></span></p>

I don't really want to just surrender my PC to a botnet that could be aimed at ANYTHING…) if/when they changed (by working in conjunction with the driving force of the raid in IRC, ie people from /baphomet/).<br />Being able to generate a session should require an additional piece of software to act as a barrier to fucktards, that newfag idiots would be too retarded to find / too shitscared to download if they found it. That would leave the important shit in the hands of people who actually cared about it, while allowing anyone to join the public botnet (but not fire until the countdown timer hit 0 / other parameters were met)<br />This would allow widespread advertisement of the raid and new LOIC to anywhere that would listen, generating a large group of people all under the 'guidance' of /baphomet/, or a proxy group such as 4chan's /b/ for max lulz and 0 blame<br />Sorry if this makes no sense, I'm slightly very drunk. Anyway, I seem to recall Anonymous using something like this a few years back, but I don't know enough about this shit to be able to pass judgement. Regardless, I think the best way for us to actually advance ourselves as social justice warrior warriors is to gain the (unknowing) support of others.<br />Side note, would it be possible to encourage SJWs into ddossing what they thought was 8chan with a program like I suggested, but really have them hit their own shitty sites? We could then post proof to the owners / domain providers for lulz

      <title>Is science denialism just a right wing problem?</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div>
        
<p>The idea that antiscience tendencies are just a right-wing thing is often presented. In this post I will argue that science denialism is as big a problem for the left as for the right. The right wing examples of this are clear and blatant; creationism, climate change skepticism, issues excepting basic public health knowledge, and so on. However, the left has its own skeletons in the closet. Antiscience is something that comes out of ideology. Strict ideology and partisanship is the mind killer. In some ideological fact become such a part of someone's worldview that is beyond reproach them, denial of facts is a simple consequence. Many people want a world where the facts neatly aligned with their political beliefs, as these beliefs that come stronger, more partisan, more ideological the contradictions between the belief and the real world will become more acute. A vast portion of the antiscience tendencies and current politics come from this tendency. It is easy to try to adjust the facts to your belief, instead of the other way around. The only way to prevent people from denying basic facts of science is to train people to be rational and to put behind partisanship and ideology when the facts clearly contradict deeply held beliefs. It's not primarily a problem of lack of education, <a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/2015/01/education-plus-ideology-exaggerates-rejection-of-reality/">studies have looked at this and found that generally education is little to do with science denying tendencies and can in fact make them worse in some cases</a>, it's a problem of politics and people. The fact that people often deny reality conflicts with their subjective viewpoint creates something I've heard called "crank magnetism". Crackpot ideas are rarely alone, and someone who believes one crank theory likely believes another. Really, I think politics has a lot to with this. A lot of people don't want to accept facts that are inconvenient to their political ideology. And some people are more likely to reject facts to preserve their ideology than others. Just in my contacts, I've noticed a lot of overlap between global warming denialism ,creationism, and general conspiracy theories (new world order, Illuminati , birtherism, Agenda 21, moon landing hoax, etc...) . These people tend to be politically right wing. I've also noticed a left-wing crank cluster. Anti-GMO crap, alternative medicine, homeopathy, vitalism, problems accepting some basic principles of economics (this last one could probably be put as both an issue of the left-wing and right-wing, but it's probably more problematic in the left, I'll discuss more about how people's understandings of economics can elucidate a lot about how people come to deny facts in a later post) and a general persistence of Freudian type psychoanalytic ideas in much of left-wing  (particularly feminist academic theory). Additionally<a href="http://old.richarddawkins.net/articles/824-postmodernism-disrobed">, persistence of so-called "postmodernist" ideas in left-wing theory also tell us a lot about antiscience in the left</a>. Anti-vaccine nonsense seems to be the one overlap between the two. I will go into a bit more about that left-wing crackpot cluster.</p>
<ol><li>As I have discussed earlier in this blog, opposition to genetically modified foods from the left is absurd and reflective of many the antiscience trends in the left. Pretty much every major public health organization in the world is concluded there is little risk to the health of the public from GM foods. In fact, there is quite a bit of potential from this technology. And use of genetic modification by many accounts has increased agricultural yields. While there are some legitimate issues of the current deployment of technologies, there are few issues that are unique to this industry (anti-GMO activists will often point out the patent trolling by many companies in this industry, but patent trolling is becoming pretty common across the tech world). And there is pretty much no scientific basis to GMO bans or GMO labeling mandates, in fact many GMO labeling proposals produce substantial constitutional issues.
</li><li>Certain types of hipster left-wingers seem strongly attracted to alternative medicine. But there is a reason why most alternative medicine is "alternative". It doesn't work. Medicine that works is just called "medicine". Homeopathy is a particular type of alternative medicine that has a very large following. The scientific evidence on the subject unequivocally indicates that homeopathy treatments simply put, do not work at all, in fact the core theories of homeopathy violate fundamental principles of physics, chemistry, and biology. Homeopathy treatments are usually diluted to such an extent and there is little to no active ingredient actually present in the tincture. The problem with alternative medicine is that it's use tends to displace real medicine. People waste money on quacks instead of seeing real doctors for their issues. Money and lives are put at risk. And due to opposition from the left that attempts to regulate alternative medicine, little is done to stop this damage.
</li><li>Embedded in both the opposition to GMOs and the belief in alternative medicine is a pseudo-vitalism. A lot of people believe in some kind of inherent life force found in living things that is not found elsewhere. There is, of course, absolutely no scientific evidence for such a thing.
</li><li>I'll discuss some of the issues of economics in a later post.
</li><li>The pseudoscientific tendencies much of critical theory and the like is clear. A lot of this very embeds a pseudoscientific quasi-Freudian understanding of human psychology, particularly the idea of the deep subconscious which is reflected by people's thoughts and the media in the art that results from these thoughts. Since this is a detailed enough subject to be worth quite a bit more time than I could give it in this single post, I will probably write an additional post on the subject.

<p><span style="font-size:12pt">The trolling done by members of websites like 4chan and 8chan has been branching out into more mainstream websites. Among the targets of this trolling are many political websites, particularly many in the feminist community. However, as trolling gets farther from the tech <img align="right" src="http://www.theojones.name/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/011715_0817_DontTakeTro12.jpg" alt="">community, which is one of the few Internet communities that really understands trolling and how to properly respond to it, you can see many communities respond very poorly to trolling. On many political communities, one particularly common mistake is to take trolls as somehow representing an honestly presented viewpoint. However, this is a gross misunderstanding of what trolls are. Trolls are simply there to stir up trouble in the get as strong a response as possible their target community. Trolls are not honest brokers of opinion in a community. They are in it to upset people for the lulz. The 4Chan community is targeted many feminist blogs and other feminist communities for trolling. The response in many publications has been to assume that the 4Chan trolls are simply presenting an antifeminist viewpoint in a particularly obnoxious way. However, this is not true. The trolls have simply discovered that elements in the feminist community make a good target for trolling that gets them a desired response. The same trolls of fit a wide variety of targets. Here are some of the targets that were hit by 4chan trolls roughly at the same time as the feminist blogs:<br /></span></p>
<ol><li><span style="font-size:12pt">The <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/gamergate" class="p-category" rel="tag">#gamergate</a> trolling - 4chan and eight Chan trolls really created the whole <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/gamergate" class="p-category" rel="tag">#gamergate</a> thing. I guess you could say this is trolling targeted at the feminist community. But it's not just targeted that community, it's also targeted the tech and gaming community as a whole.
</span></li><li><span style="font-size:12pt">Trolling targeting various conservative and right-wing groups.
</span></li><li><span style="font-size:12pt">The Ebola Chan trolling. 4chan trolls circulated myths about Ebola being spread by Western doctors on forms frequented by many people in the affected countries. This trolling of course, is not because they hate the populations in these countries. Instead, the 4chan trolls know a prank like this will get tons of media coverage and bring in the lulz.
</span></li><li><span style="font-size:12pt">The Apple Wave trolling. 4chan trolls circulated the rumor that claim that owners of iPhones can charge your device by placing it in a microwave.
</span></li><li><span style="font-size:12pt">The <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/cutforbieber" class="p-category" rel="tag">#cutforbieber</a> trolling.
</span></li><li><span style="font-size:12pt">And finally, the wide range of swattings and mundane harassment done by the trolls.
</span></li></ol>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt">The one thing that unifies all this stuff is lulz. Lulz is the primary goal of an Internet troll. It is the humor value the troll obtains from causing trouble for someone else. Trolls simply want to see the world burn. The people not familiar with the Internet trolling culture the idea of people who seek destruction and disruption might be a bit hard to understand. But it is what motivates your common Internet troll. If you at all look at sites like 4chan and 8chan , and various other troll hideouts you'll be amazed at the level of effort trolls put in the causing people trouble. Is a passion that motivates and most every day of these guys' lives. They spend months in nursing some of the sock puppet accounts they use in their trolling. A plan intricately detailed operations against the websites they are targeting. But what trolls are not our political ideologues. Sure, trolls are pretty good at pointing out the weaknesses of the communities they are targeting, and they know about limits to the political ideologies advocated by these communities. And they are even better at weapon these weaknesses against the communities. However, they do not particularly care about the outcome of these disputes. It's just another source of lulz for them. And that right there is what many people do not get about trolls.</span></p>

<p>I've been pretty skeptical about the future of smart watches. Sure, they are getting a whole lot of attention, but are they really good for? As far as I can tell not very much. There's some benefit to having the ability to push out arbitrary data to the user handheld scale device. But really that benefit is dwarfed by the fact that smart watches are vastly inferior at being, well watches. Battery life can see the real killer of smart watch designs. Pretty much every smart watch on the market that I've seen is the battery life that's in days. A traditional watch can go years, or at least months without a recharge. There are other clear advantages of traditional watches over smart watches, for example, a smart watch pretty much is it going to be waterproof. Traditional watches are waterproof, this allows them to be used in situations like swimming pools and such. Really, about the only reasonable use of smart watches I've seen are fitness tracking related apps. But, this is a pretty niche use. Most the population isn't going to want a hundred and fifty dollars device that exists simply do slightly increase the ease of tracking their running performance. I'm critical of smart watches a pretty earlier adopter of PDAs and other proto-smartphones. Years before the iPhone came out, I had multiple Palm OS PDAs. But it was pretty clear at that point there was a clear use for a computer that can fit in your pocket. The screens of PDAs and smart phones are more than large enough to convey useful data to the user and to allow nontrivial input from the user. Palm OS PDAs, even though they were early and immature, still had a pretty great use in my workflow. They were decent for notetaking and basic calendar use, the ability load simple applications on to them allowed them to do other stuff like simple gaming. The main problem with Palm OS was some of their clunky interface issues, and their missing of a few critical details. Palm OS PDAs, even though they were general-purpose computers trying to still keep some interaction like that of a simple peripheral. In Palm OS PDAs could only sync through a relatively clunky Palm desktop application. With the iPhone, Steve Jobs had an pretty critical insight, design a smart phone like a general-purpose computer that could function completely autonomously of other devices. The thing was smart phone were good enough to be a second computer for the user. However I am not seeing such a niche for the smart watch. First of all pretty much all smart watches in existence are nearly fully dependent on the smart phone. Which means outside of a few niche uses for them, like the uses for the early PDAs, there's not much reason why a typical user would want one when they could just use their smart phone for most of the features. And even worse for the future of the smart watch, due to their input and output limitations I don't see much improvement on this front as a possibility. What really would a smart watch is an independent device be good for? I don't see much. The few best designs I've seen the smart watch, have come close to tantalizing but still have critical limitations. Microsoft Band is a good example of this. This smart watch is a nice interface and a fairly clean touch based input. With the band Microsoft seems to be targeting the fitness market, and the few people who want instant notifications of incoming text and email. The first thing to note about this smart watch is that it's battery life straight up crippling. With the band you can only expect about a day or so of battery life. That's not good. But $200 costs of the band also is not good. These limitations will make it unable to exceed the cost of value ratio of the normal watch for the vast majority of users. Another interesting smart watch design the targets the battery life issue is that by the manufacturer Martian. This smart watch divides the watch part in the smart part in to two halves. The upper part of this watch is a simple analog clock. Below this clock is a ticker that shows the output. This solves the battery life issues to some degree. The smart part is a battery life of a few days, but the actual watch part runs on a separate battery and can run for years. However the reducing of the input-output makes the other issues of the smart watch even more acute. Watch live a ticker like that can do even less than other smart watches. That data can be displayed and the range of user interface interactions are severely reduced. Added at the fact that the price tag is over $200, and you don't get a good cost of value ratio. The problems of our so inherent in the form factor but I doubt any designer will be able to bypass them. There is one type of smart device that I think has a lot of future. Smart pens. I have a Livescribe pen, and live this device I see a lot of the same issues I saw early Palm OS devices. The pen can only sync through this "Livescribe desktop" application, an application is quite crippling the functionality of the whole device. However despite this smart pen has really integrated itself into my overall personal workflow. The simple way around the current limitations of these pens would be to simply make Smart pens independent device, just like was done with smart phones. I will probably elaborate on this later in a future post.</p>

      <title>Rare events get more attention than frequent ones, or why people care more about terrorists in France than Nigeria</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div>
        
<p>On Facebook and twitter I've seen a number of people posting about how the recent terrorist attacks in Nigeria by Boko Haram among other groups have not received as much coverage as the French terrorist attack. These posters point out that the Nigerian attacks claimed many more lives than the French terrorists. However that is the same reason that the Nigerian attacks are not getting covered. Media prefers to give coverage to rare that destructive events, and does not like to give coverage to more common events even if the more common events in combined are much more destructive. This is a persistent media bias that occurs across multiple different fields.<img align="left" src="http://www.theojones.name/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/011515_0603_Rareeventsg1.jpg" alt=""><span style="color:#44546a; font-size:9pt"><em>British anti-terrorism poster via <a href="https://flic.kr/p/5hm7vX"></a><a href="https://flic.kr/p/5hm7vX">https:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>flic.kr/<wbr></wbr>p/<wbr></wbr>5hm7vX</a><br /></em></span></p>

<p> It seen in discussions of energy policy, gun policy, climate change, transportation policy, tech policy and many other different fields. It's the reason why you're much more likely to have heard the likes of Fukushima or Chernobyl then the many smaller accidents and disasters of occurred with conventional energy sources. It's why in discussions of gun policy relatively rare mass shootings have received much more attention in a much more frequent regular shootings and gang violence. It's why something like the disappearing Malaysian planes ever see much more coverage than the frequent car wrecks the claim tens of thousands of lives. Many commentators have tried to frame the lack of coverage in Nigeria is a side effect of racism. However treating it as a symptom of media bias towards large and rare events is much more likely. The Nigerian conflict claimed almost 4000 lives in just 2014 alone. And this conflict occurred in one of the most war prone areas in the world, a part of the world where some of the most destructive conflicts ever have occurred. Unfortunately, what happened in Nigeria is a very common event. For after a kidnapping in the Nigerian school girls this conflict received a lot of coverage, the media simply got tired of the subject because the destruction is so ubiquitous, the press moved on to a juicier subject.  The possibility of racism is a main driver of the lack of coverage given to Nigeria can be eliminated simply due to the fact that ignoring large events is so common among the press. This can also be eliminated to the wide range of politicians and officials who expressed concern about the conflict in Nigeria. Here are just a few examples of the press giving more time to a major but rare event into much more common related event.</p>
<ul><li>An obvious example of this is the recent Malaysian plane crash. Plane crashes are exceedingly rare, much rarer than car crashes. However, the Malaysian plane crashes received 24-7 coverage from number of media outlets. The reason for this is pretty much that plane crashes are something that people perceive as high risk but which are in reality a very infrequent low risk thing. Air travel is on the safest forms of mass transportation and transportation in general. When you divide the number of fatalities by the number of passenger miles traveled you obtain a result of dispels the commonly held perception that flying is dangerous. <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/space/how-risky-is-flying.html">One report determined</a> that the risk of being killed in a plane crash for the typical American is about one and 11 million per year, however the equivalent risk of dying in a car accident is about one in 5000. When varying number of passenger miles traveled is taken into account, comes out to be that air travel is about as safe as driving a car or riding a train. The number of deaths per mile traveled turns out to be about the same for each mode of transit. Car crashes and railway accidents account for about 1.3 deaths per hundred million vehicle miles. Motorcycles count for about 31.3 deaths per hundred vehicle miles traveled, making it one most dangerous forms of transit widely used. And when plane crashes do happen they are single events that cause a lot of damage at once. A rare event that causes a lot of damage? That something journalists will want to cover.
</li><li>Another good example of this can be found in the energy industry. Nuclear energy is one of the safest forms of energy <a href="http://nextbigfuture.com/2011/03/deaths-per-twh-by-energy-source.html">and when you divide the amount of fatalities caused by nuclear accidents by the amount of energy produced in reactors</a>, the number is very low compared to many other major sources of energy. Fossil fuels and biomass energy are among the top most lethal energy sources and nabbed in Trieste relaxants there much more frequent than nuclear energy's accidents, and which are in aggregate much more destructive. You could probably name and number of well-known nuclear accidents. Chernobyl. Fukushima. Three Mile Island. These types of rare but high destruction at once events get a lot of media coverage. The public's view of the frequency of these accidents is highly distorted. Nuclear is perceived as one of the more dangerous energy sources around, when in fact it is one of the safer ones. Coal is by far the most dangerous energy source, air pollution produced and industrial accidents caused are factored into the death toll. Depending on the type of coal and how it is used, coal causes between 60 and 170 deaths per terawatt hour. Oil is second on the death count, coming in at about 32 deaths per terawatt hour equivalent. Biofuels are the next on the list causing about 12 deaths per terawatt hour equivalent generated (this does not include the fairly high death count caused by competition with the food supply for fuel feedstock, the excess deaths due to this are counted biofuels have a death toll that exceeds coal). Nuclear's fatalities are very low at about 0.04 deaths per terawatt hour.
</li><li>You can think of many other examples of this phenomenon happening in the media. I could for example mention the excess attention in the media given to mass shootings over regular crime. Or for that manner the excess attention given to terrorism in general compared to the many other threats facing the world. Or the wide distortion of perceptions of disease threats. People were treating the Ebola crisis as if it were a science fiction disaster movie coming to life. I can mention the relatively low priority given to the many mundane diseases around. Humans are terrible at perceiving risk, media coverage is no exception.</li></ul><p><a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/denialismantiscience" class="p-category" rel="tag">#denialismantiscience</a> <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/france" class="p-category" rel="tag">#france</a> <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/nigeria" class="p-category" rel="tag">#nigeria</a> <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/threemileisland" class="p-category" rel="tag">#threemileisland</a></p></div>]]></description>

<p><img align="left" src="http://www.theojones.name/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/011315_0655_ReligionsSh1.jpg" alt=""><span style="font-size:14pt">With the aftermath of the shootings at the office of the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, there seems to be a number of people on social media, and on <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/01/10/1356555/-On-not-being-Charlie">left-wing websites like Daly Kos</a> who seem to think the religion should be beyond criticism and mockery. One thing to note, is that contrary to what many of our friendly social justice warriors have said (Yes, I know that talking of SJWs gets a strong response, but that phrase contains the right level of derision for this dumb idea),the magazine in question is not an extremist or racist one and is well within the mainstream of French politics. The magazine has received many awards for its work and its authors are <a href="http://www.cpj.org/blog/2015/01/charlie-hebdo-attack-unites-france-on-free-express.php">well known and respected within the French journalism community</a>.  As the image to the right shows, the mockery towards religion published by those journalists is nondenominational as many major religions get their dose of mockery from Charlie Hebdo. Perhaps it is true that the authors were trolling Islamic extremists to some extent by publishing cartoons of the Prophet. But that does not make the magazine unacceptably racist. Instead of in opposition to racism, but many of the critics the magazine are instead proposing is that religion should be immune from criticism. That religion is something above other ideologies of beliefs should be treated specially. Religion is treated as some type of immutable characteristic of a person like sex or race. Therefore is street is something that is beyond criticism that any dislike of a given religion amounts to bigotry. This is the same sentiment that got political comedian Bill Maher into trouble after criticizing the growth of Islamic extremism in Europe. The thing is religion should not be treated differently than any other community or ideology or belief system. A religion is just an ideology and belief system with sky fairies. Perhaps it is true that criticism of Islam gets used as a cover for actual anti-Arab racists but, that does not mean that there is no such thing as legitimate criticism of the religion and the rising extremism within it. It is also true that rising immigration into Europe from many authoritarian countries has created new type of resident of Europe, and has created a population of many people dispute fundamental tenants of free and democratic society. <a href="http://www.inquisitr.com/1743767/bill-maher-refuses-to-lay-off-islam-slings-more-insults-on-his-own-show/">As was noted in the controversial edition of Bill Maher's show</a>, almost a quarter of British Muslims believe that the government should execute individuals who have converted away from Islam. This type of extremist ideology certainly deserves all the mockery in criticism that can receive. However many people prefer to deny that it exists at all. These people prefer to believe that terrorism is due to a few lone wolf extremists. Islam in general deserves some criticism for creating an environment where extremism is part of the mainstream. It's a lot like the <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/GamerGate" class="p-category" rel="tag">#GamerGate</a> stuff I have discussed earlier in this blog. It's clear that an unusual amount of sexism in toxicity has come from the gaming community compared to other similarly sized Internet communities. And likewise is clear that Islam produces lot more extremism than other major world religions. As Bill Maher put it on a recent episode: <em>"Obviously, the vast majority of Muslims would never do anything like this, But they share bad ideas. This is the thing that caused the big ruckus when Ben Affleck was here. Sam Harris said, 'Islam is the motherlode of bad ideas,' and everyone went fucking nuts on this side of the panel. But it is. These two guys who shot up the cartoonists the other day, they were avenging the prophet, they said? A bad idea. Martyrdom? A bad idea. Women as second-class citizens? A bad idea. And unfortunately, the terrorists and the mainstream share a lot of these bad ideas.</em>" People rightfully saw the error in buuut…  <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/NotAllGamers" class="p-category" rel="tag">#NotAllGamers</a>. Sure there are plenty of gamers who are not sexist trogs, but their community is a magnet for problem types. Now see the same with religion. </span></p>

<p>I'm in the market for an over-the-air TV antenna to go with a TV tuner, and while searching I've noticed more than a few sellers advertising antennas that can get ranges as high as 150 miles.   [caption id="attachment_1440" align="alignright" width="300"]<a href="http://www.theojones.name/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1802424443_21761d4caa_o.jpg"><img src="http://www.theojones.name/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1802424443_21761d4caa_o-300x213.jpg" alt="Image via Flickr user  anomalous4 &lt;a href=" https:>https:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>flic.kr/<wbr></wbr>p/<wbr></wbr>3KgTZv</a>" width="300" height="213" class="size-medium wp-image-1440" /&gt; Image via Flickr user  anomalous4<br /><a href="https://flic.kr/p/3KgTZv%5B/caption%5DSuch">https:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>flic.kr/<wbr></wbr>p/<wbr></wbr>3KgTZv[/<wbr></wbr>caption]Such</a> a thing would be neat as it would allow me reach signals from other cities. But it is too good to be true. Such a device would violate the laws of physics considering the methods used to broadcast TV signals. You will be unlikely to find an antenna that gets more than 60 miles of range, and getting more than 50 miles will come at a high price premium. However, there are lots of people who seem to have fallen for this scam and brought these devices. There are two clear issues that prevent the creation of such a device, at least at a reasonable price. The first is the inverse-square law  of light. Even assuming a flat Earth, a radio signal declines in proportion to square of the distance. Because TV broadcasts are information rich, the antenna needs to catch a lot of information from the broadcast. But the strength of the signal rapidly declines as the broadcast gets farther away. And as there are three dimensions of space that the signal is spreading out in, this change isn't merely linear -- its quadratic.  When the distance doubles the signal (and the cost of picking it up) quadruples. When the distance doubles, the signal reduces nine-fold, when the distance quadruples the signal reduces 16 fold.   There is a second, even more restrictive limit on the creation of a long range antenna -- the fact that the earth is curved. This curvature enforces a line of sight on radio transmissions and therefore sets a maximum range for radio transmissions. Were the broadcasting station merely suspended in space the signal would go out evenly in all directions. However, in the real world, the Earth provides an obstruction. Therefore, the signal is directional, and as the recipient of the signal moves farther away the curvature of the Earth means that he is facing in a direction that is blocked by the Earth. Therefore the recipient is unable to receive the signal past the line of sight.</p>

      <title>More Irrational Ebola Panic: 30 Year Old Ohio Small Business Shuts Down Because an Ebola Victim Shopped There</title>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/09/us/ebola-store-ohio-bridal-shop-where-ebola-patient-shopped-will-close.html?_r=0">According to the New York Times, a small business bridal store in Ohio has closed its doors</a>due to public concern due to Ebola. A victim of the virus shopped there while infected but asymptomatic (and therefore non-contagious). [caption id="attachment_1443" align="alignright" width="300"]<a href="http://www.theojones.name/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/2537685236_0eb9a6c92f_o.jpg"><img src="http://www.theojones.name/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/2537685236_0eb9a6c92f_o-300x138.jpg" alt="Image via CDC." width="300" height="138" class="size-medium wp-image-1443"></a> Image via CDC.[/caption]The store replaced its inventory and conducted an intensive cleaning and when it reopened after the cleaning it had the support of a number of local officials. However, the fact that there was no reasonable threat to the public didn't stop people from avoiding the store because of its Ebola "connection". The sales of the store halved after the re-opening. This store is a victim of a public that does not understand basic science. It is the victim  of irrational paranoia over an extremely rare virus. A basic understand of the facts of medicine would give a typical individual little to fear in such a situation. Only two people have caught the virus in the United States and the clear facts of the biology of the virus show that the infected individual was not contagious. The fact that irrational parinoa destroyed that small business is outrageous.</p>
