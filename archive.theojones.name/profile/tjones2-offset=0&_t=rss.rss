      <description><![CDATA[<div>
        <p>There have been a few recent <a href="http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2015/10/whats-the-moral-difference-between-ad-blocking-and-piracy/">controversies</a> about internet adblocking. <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/sep/18/peace-app-ad-blocker-pulled-marco-arment-iphone-ios-9">The most prominent of these</a> has been Apple's decision to allow ad-blocking software on the App Store for Ipads. I will admit to running adblocking software on my computer and on the pfsense box I use as a router. I realsize that there are some issues with this. I get that there is an impact on the revinue of the websites I visit, as many websites use cost per impression ads that pay out based on the number of visitors to the website. I know that there have been cases where ad blockers have abused their control over the blocklists inorder to make profit. Adblock Plus, for instance, will de-list the ads on a website -- for a fee. However, there are some reasons why I use adblocking software on my computer</p><ol><li>Tracking and privacy. Advertisers use their networks to monitor what websites the viewers of the ads go to, and keep a databse of this tracking. They use this information about web browsing habits to create a profile of each user, and to guess at a wide range of other personal information. This information is used to "target" the ad to the users, and is quite often sold to other companies. This is a substintial violation of privacy and one of the main reasons I ad block. </li>
<li>Computer performance issues. A lot of ads contain flash/javascript code that is quite ram and CPU hogging. </li>
<li>Secutity issues. There have been cases where ads have contained malware. Which isn't surprising, considering that the core of internet targeted advertising is to load untrusted content onto the website you are viewing. Due to the need to keep advertising "targeted" this is pretty much unavoidable under the current internet marketing model. </li>
<li>These problems are at the core of the internet advertising model. Unlike a dead-tree publication, you can't effectively target on geographic location, or the like. So, the much more intrusive methods of advertising become unavoidable. </li>

    <blockquote><p><em>"But I’m more optimistic! If you debate pro-lifers on the object-level issues like “Does a woman’s right to privacy outweigh a fetus’ right to life” or some other horrible muddled version of the question like that, then no, you will never be able to make progress. But if you devote yourself to the actual substantive disagreement – which is on the level of what meta-ethics to use or maybe even further back – then you can either change some minds or, at the very least “be confused on a higher level and about more important things”. This continues to be my strategy and I’m pretty happy with how it’s worked out."</em></p></blockquote></div>

    <blockquote><p>"Anyway, this makes me go back to my religion focus. Why would these social justice movements have rhetoric whose underlying structure is alarmingly religious in nature? Probably because what’s effective socially isn’t restricted to time and space. It’s not that religious-logic is inherently due to religion itself, but it’s due to how our brains are wired for social cohesion and ostracism. It’s probably no coincidence that the most successful social justice movement in the 20th century was spearheaded by a man who earned his doctorate in theology. Religion, civil rights, feminism, pro/anti-semitism, etc. are all inherently political in nature (the strict demarcation of politics and religion is a product of the Enlightenment for — surprise — social purposes. Of course, Islam had no Enlightenment so they are still one and the same for Muslims) and so religion, civil rights, feminism, pro/anti-semitism, etc. are all mind-killers:"</p></blockquote></div>

      <title>'Sexist' Scientist Tim Hunt: The Real Story - Reason.com</title>

    <blockquote><p>"This is particularly shameful given that Hunt is not only a great scientist but, by many accounts, a genuine friend to women in science. There are numerous testimonials from women describing him as a caring and inspirational mentor, one who never treated his female students and colleagues differently from their male peers and has aided in their advancement. European Research Council president Jean-Pierre Bourguignon is on record as saying that Hunt "actively supported" the Council’s initiatives to support women in science. The only charge of sexism anyone has tried to pin on him beyond his ill-considered remarks in Seoul is a 2014 interview in which he dared to suggest that the numerical disparities between men and women in science are not necessarily a huge problem. But this hardly means, as fellow UCL scientist David Colquhoun has insinuated on his blog, that Hunt also seriously believes women shouldn’t work in science alongside men. (Ironically, as Mensch has discovered, Colquhoun himself had to field accusations of sexism on Twitter only a few months ago after voicing the heretical opinions that the paucity of women in senior scientific positions was due to different family roles, not sexism"</p></blockquote></div>

    <blockquote><p>"Ah yes, the old “It’s just banter” defence. That worked so well when used by racist footballers. My own use of social media follows the principle “Never say on Twitter what you can’t justify to your employer or your mum”. That would have been good advice for Bahar Mustafa, or indeed anyone in a highly visible public position."</p></blockquote></div>

    <blockquote><p>"I have very little time for the speech-policing identity politics driven by postmodernist critical theory that’s taken root in parts of academia and the media; it’s profoundly illiberal. But if freedom of speech is to mean anything at all, it means the right to speak ill-informed complete cobblers that others may find offensive. And the right to ridicule that ill-informed complete cobblers without mercy."</p></blockquote></div>

      <title>Should I Upgrade to Mac OS X El Capitan?</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="known-bookmark">
    <blockquote><p>"One thing in El Capitan you might want to pay attention to is a new security feature called System Integrity Protection (SIP), which has the potential to break some apps. In short, Apple introduced it as a way to limit even the level of access that root users and processes have, and to protect core components of the OS. That means there are some things you won’t be able to do, even if you have and use root. You can read the nitty gritty over at Ars Technica. This also means some applications that leverage root won’t work anymore—one notable example is Bartender, before it was recently updated with El Capitan support. It’s not a huge problem, and you can disable it, but in all reality most people won’t need to and shouldn’t have to. However, some programs may need to be updated before they’ll work—and if you’re using some long-abandoned apps that have worked up to this point and they break, well, they could be dead for good, and you’ll have to make the call to disable it or find an alternative."</p></blockquote></div>

<p>"First, you censorious Guardians of Feels on the Left: if you thought that the norms you created wouldn't be used against your "own side," you're fools. It is apparently your theory that the law is sexist, racist, and every other -ist, driven by privilege and wealth, and that free speech norms serve to protect rich white guys — yet somehow exceptions to free speech norm will be imposed in an egalitarian, progressive way. That is almost indescribably moronic. Go sit in the corner and think about what you have done."</p>

    <blockquote><p>"The first is one well known to youse guys in the tech industry: network effects. The first fax machine isn't all that much use and every other one added to the network adds to the usefulness of every other one. This is obviously true of Facebitch, of the internet in general and so on: and it's also true, to some extent at least, of the gig and sharing economy behemoths like Airbnb and Uber. The more people that use them the more supply there will be for people to use, attracting more people and so on. So, the game that, as organisations, all of these people are engaging in is the attempt to be the network for whatever it is; eBay for tchotchke, Uber for transportation, Google for ad slinging and Amazon for, erm, tchotchke."</p></blockquote></div>

    <blockquote><p>"Today is the day that Apple is releasing El Capitan for users around the globe and if you are thinking about running the latest version of Office 2016 with this new OS, you need to be aware of performance issues. I have been running the GM candidates and the release build of El Capitan since it was first announced by Apple as well as running the release version of Office 2016 for Mac and the experience is atrocious. I am not alone in this either, there is a lengthy thread in Microsoft’s Answer forums that is filled with other users who have the same issue and users on Twitter are quite vocal about problem as well."</p></blockquote></div>
