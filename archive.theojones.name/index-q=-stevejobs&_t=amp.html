<p>I've been pretty skeptical about the future of smart watches. Sure, they are getting a whole lot of attention, but are they really good for? As far as I can tell not very much. There's some benefit to having the ability to push out arbitrary data to the user handheld scale device. But really that benefit is dwarfed by the fact that smart watches are vastly inferior at being, well watches. Battery life can see the real killer of smart watch designs. Pretty much every smart watch on the market that I've seen is the battery life that's in days. A traditional watch can go years, or at least months without a recharge. There are other clear advantages of traditional watches over smart watches, for example, a smart watch pretty much is it going to be waterproof. Traditional watches are waterproof, this allows them to be used in situations like swimming pools and such. Really, about the only reasonable use of smart watches I've seen are fitness tracking related apps. But, this is a pretty niche use. Most the population isn't going to want a hundred and fifty dollars device that exists simply do slightly increase the ease of tracking their running performance. I'm critical of smart watches a pretty earlier adopter of PDAs and other proto-smartphones. Years before the iPhone came out, I had multiple Palm OS PDAs. But it was pretty clear at that point there was a clear use for a computer that can fit in your pocket. The screens of PDAs and smart phones are more than large enough to convey useful data to the user and to allow nontrivial input from the user. Palm OS PDAs, even though they were early and immature, still had a pretty great use in my workflow. They were decent for notetaking and basic calendar use, the ability load simple applications on to them allowed them to do other stuff like simple gaming. The main problem with Palm OS was some of their clunky interface issues, and their missing of a few critical details. Palm OS PDAs, even though they were general-purpose computers trying to still keep some interaction like that of a simple peripheral. In Palm OS PDAs could only sync through a relatively clunky Palm desktop application. With the iPhone, Steve Jobs had an pretty critical insight, design a smart phone like a general-purpose computer that could function completely autonomously of other devices. The thing was smart phone were good enough to be a second computer for the user. However I am not seeing such a niche for the smart watch. First of all pretty much all smart watches in existence are nearly fully dependent on the smart phone. Which means outside of a few niche uses for them, like the uses for the early PDAs, there's not much reason why a typical user would want one when they could just use their smart phone for most of the features. And even worse for the future of the smart watch, due to their input and output limitations I don't see much improvement on this front as a possibility. What really would a smart watch is an independent device be good for? I don't see much. The few best designs I've seen the smart watch, have come close to tantalizing but still have critical limitations. Microsoft Band is a good example of this. This smart watch is a nice interface and a fairly clean touch based input. With the band Microsoft seems to be targeting the fitness market, and the few people who want instant notifications of incoming text and email. The first thing to note about this smart watch is that it's battery life straight up crippling. With the band you can only expect about a day or so of battery life. That's not good. But $200 costs of the band also is not good. These limitations will make it unable to exceed the cost of value ratio of the normal watch for the vast majority of users. Another interesting smart watch design the targets the battery life issue is that by the manufacturer Martian. This smart watch divides the watch part in the smart part in to two halves. The upper part of this watch is a simple analog clock. Below this clock is a ticker that shows the output. This solves the battery life issues to some degree. The smart part is a battery life of a few days, but the actual watch part runs on a separate battery and can run for years. However the reducing of the input-output makes the other issues of the smart watch even more acute. Watch live a ticker like that can do even less than other smart watches. That data can be displayed and the range of user interface interactions are severely reduced. Added at the fact that the price tag is over $200, and you don't get a good cost of value ratio. The problems of our so inherent in the form factor but I doubt any designer will be able to bypass them. There is one type of smart device that I think has a lot of future. Smart pens. I have a Livescribe pen, and live this device I see a lot of the same issues I saw early Palm OS devices. The pen can only sync through this "Livescribe desktop" application, an application is quite crippling the functionality of the whole device. However despite this smart pen has really integrated itself into my overall personal workflow. The simple way around the current limitations of these pens would be to simply make Smart pens independent device, just like was done with smart phones. I will probably elaborate on this later in a future post.</p>
