<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2015/06/uberharm.jpg.html"><amp-img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2427" src="http://www.theojones.name/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/uberharm.jpg" alt="uberharm" width="640" height="360"></a>Uber recently lost an administrative decision in California over whether their drivers are independent contractors or employees. <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/dandiamond/2015/06/17/if-uber-drivers-are-employees-company-faces-hard-decision-on-health-care/">This could have very important implications for the company</a>. It would mean that the company is bound by a wide variety of regulations that fall on companies that hire employees. Uber would be bound to pay employees the minimum wage (regardless of the number of rides given), health benefits, it would be bound by working hours regulations, and many other regulation. Probably worst of all for the company, Uber would have to cover the business expenses of employees, or at least take them into account in tabulating wages paid. This was not a positive ruling for Uber. But to this outcome, I say it’s about time. Uber's entire business model is to ignore every regulation on their industry to keep costs down. Now, some of these regulations are useless. But Uber throws out the good with the bad. It’s nice to hear that regulators are finally "disrupting" them. Now, I will say that the conventional taxi system is pretty terrible. Where I live there aren't too many outright ripoff cab drivers, but there are ones that are 20 minutes late and which are otherwise unreliable. When you get to larger cities that are more dependent on cabs, it gets even worse some of the problems with cabs across the country is due to shitty regulations (hello, New York City medallion system). I can see why people like Uber and use their products, as they provide a very strong improvement over other taxi networks. However, as I said before they toss out the good with the bad in regards to regulations. In this post I’ll discuss some things I believe solidly that Uber should change with their business model.</p>

<p>The first big issue with Uber is their limited insurance for their drivers. There are very strong reasons why anyone driving for a business should have commercial insurance. Regular car insurance does not cover business driving. However, many of Uber’s drivers are driving illegally without the proper commercial insurance, posing strong legal risk to them, to consumers, and to other motorists. Fortunately, Uber has made some improvements on this issue recently by proving their drivers a limited secondary insurance policy for their Uber driving. But it’s not enough, and the coverage this provides is quite limited and poorly fits the legal requirements on commercial driving. This lack of insurance also serves to externalize costs on to the public. If an Uber driver gets into a car wreck while driving, both the victim of the car accident, and the driver have a huge problem. The driver has a large potential liability, while the victim of the car wreck will be left out to dry. The risk created by driving safety by Uber is unloaded onto the public.</p>

<p>The second major issue with Uber is their pricing scheme. All prices on Uber are set by the company. This is bad, because the price that optimizes Uber profits might not be the socially optimal price. In fact, if you accept Uber’s line that they are just a “platform” for independent contractors then, <a href="http://www.interfluidity.com/v2/5822.html">as the economics blogger Steve Waldman points out</a>, in effect Uber is a price-fixing cartel. A more flexible form of pricing set by the drivers is possible. Also, Uber’s pricing system is highly unstable because their surge level fluctuates a lot. I (along with most consumers I would guess) would prefer a much more predictable pricing system. But congestion pricing isn’t totally useless. It is useful to charge riders more for traveling at rush hour, in order to keep cars available for those who need to travel at that time. An intermediate solution is possible. A revision for Uber’s pricing system would involve the following, allow each driver to set his price for different categories of time (ie. Morning rush hour, evening rush hour, rest of the day, night time) but encourage drivers to refrain from changing their rates too much. This would also mean that all prices are human set, avoiding issues like what happened in Sidney, Australia where <a href="http://gawker.com/uber-turned-on-surge-pricing-for-people-fleeing-sydney-1671193132">Uber surged priced people fleeing a hostage situation</a>.</p>

<p>The third major issue with Uber is their tendency to off load a lot of their costs onto the drivers in a way that is nowhere near transparent. <a href="https://get.uber.com/cl/">Uber’s page recruiting new drivers</a> states, “<em>Got a car? Turn it into a money machine. The city is buzzing and Uber makes it easy for you to cash in on the action. Plus, you've already got everything you need to get started.</em>” An ad bought by Uber on the Bing search engine states that drivers “<em>Make Up To $17/hr In Fares</em>”. Of course, this claimed pay is highly misleading. It doesn’t take into account the cost of car maintenance (which not only increase with respect with miles driven, but also should be put to the higher standards of commercial driving). It also doesn’t take into account the cost of fuel, insurance, or other necessities of driving. Probably, the adjusted pay is more like 8-10 dollars per hour. The IRS estimates (for the purposes of tax deductions) that the <a href="http://www.irs.gov/Tax-Professionals/Standard-Mileage-Rates/">non-labor cost of business miles</a> is 57 cents per mile.</p>

The "SEO" person sent me an analytics link for the url shortener used, it was reporting thousands of views a day from the campaign. The analytics on my blog reported less but still over 1000 a day. And, of course, it was fake traffic city.<br />The traffic delivered was obvious bot traffic with spoofed referral headers, instead of the genuine traffic promised in the offer. On both the analytics link the seller provided, and in the internal analytics of my website, there was a large amount of Google traffic. That traffic was almost certainly spoofed for four reasons 1) the Google webmaster tools for my website does not record anywhere near the amount of google search traffic as reported, meaning that the traffic did not go through Google, 2) it is hard to fathom any legitimate way that thousands of Google hits could be produced in a few days when my site usually has around 20 google hits, 3) the IP addresses of this traffic (on the logs of my analytics) come from data centers, and 4) there is no additional traffic from other search engines like Bing (any legitimate way of providing Google hits would of also affected other search engines). Furthermore, the retweets on the promised tweet are also almost certainly fake. These accounts have little activity. The fake tweets and the spoofed search both could have had the strong potential to harm the google ranking of my site.<br />Now, it didn’t take long for me to realize what was going on. So I requested a cancelation on Fivver with text that was effectively the same as the paragraph above. And weirdly, the “seller” accepted – pretty much just conceded and gave my money back in a few hours. I actually expected that I would have had to of gone to support for that one. But, the conclusion remains. Most such online SEO programs are blatant scams. Don’t buy them.</p>

<p>Interested in forming your own <strong><em><u>disruptive</u></em></strong> startup? Well, the Uber business seminar is for you. Learn how to <strong><em><u>disrupt</u></em></strong> competitors, consumers and regulators from the founders of Uber --- <em>Ayn Rand’s Favorite Taxi</em>.</p>
<ul><li>Learn how to turn a service that has existed for over a century into a <strong><em><u>disruptive</u></em></strong> Silicon Valley wonder, by doing the same thing, only with a computer. Learn the core of the Uber business model from someone who has practiced it for 20 years – John Smith the taxi driver.</li>
    <li>Learn how to <strong><em><u>disrupt</u></em></strong> regulations regarding your service by pretending that adding a computer means you are doing something different. Learn about the intellectual property applications of this technique from Jack Cheatem, lawyer for many IP litigation companies including Prenda Law, and Intellectual Ventures.</li>
    <li>Learn from the Uber IT team just how little you can spend on computer security without immediate impact. If you follow our method, by the time you get customer data hacked from your insecure servers, you will be a multibillion dollar company that just doesn’t need to care.</li>
    <li>Learn how to <strong><em><u>disrupt</u></em></strong> consumer behavior. Are your users attune to your high prices? Our surge pricing method will fix that. They won’t even realize how much you are charging them.</li>
    <li>Learn how to become a platform not a service. Platforms sound nice and <strong><em><u>disruptive</u></em></strong> and even better, the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">dolts</span> service providers on your platform aren’t your employees, so you don’t have to follow labor law, disability law, anti-discrimination law, or other big government red tape. And even better, the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">dolts</span> service providers on your platform won’t realize how many of your costs you outsourced to them.</li>
    <li>Discuss the books that every business man should read, including, <em>Atlas Shrugged, The Fountainhead,</em> and <em>The Virtue of Selfishness</em>.</li>
    <li>Learn how to apply the Ferengi Rules of Acquisition to your startup.</li>

<p>By its self, the phrase "social justice" is pretty meaningless. The phrase is effectively equivalent to the word "fairness". Try taking an article that uses the phrase and swapping out all occurrences of "social justice" for fairness. Very little meaning will be lost.    But "fairness" is an arbitrary concept. Almost every political ideology will perceive their goals as "fair".  Phrases like "social justice" are the political equivalent of "maximizing synergies" business speak. Such concepts are almost entirely dependent on ideology. What one will perceive as "fair" or "just is largely subjective in global terms. Every major political ideology has a different conception of the public good. Libertarians regard markets as properly "fair", others regard egalitarianism as "fair", and others take a roughly utilitarian perspective of the greatest good for the greatest number as "fair". However, the concept is still subjective.  In regards to talk of "fairness" in economic policy, <a href="http://blog.dilbert.com/post/102964895406/fairness-test">Scott Adams (the author of the Dilbert cartoon) made a similar point</a>. "<em>fairness is a concept invented so dumb people can participate in debates. Fairness isn't a natural law of the universe. It's a psychological problem. We sometimes get fairness confused with equality. Equality is usually good, and can often be measured with a satisfying precision. Fairness, on the other hand, is usually just a rationale for some sort of bias ….It's just a psychological phenomenon that is easily manipulated.</em>"</p>

<p>However, there is one case where the phrase "social justice" carries more meaning than the word "fairness". The only meaning that is conveyed by that term is signaling about the speaker. Only certain ideologies refer to their goals as maximizing social justice. This gets us to pejoratives like "SJW".  So when a gater rants about "SJWs" they are attacking the ideologies refer to their goals as maximizing social justice. However, SJW is a strong pejorative. Using it is like saying "M$" in a discussion about Windows 10. It removes any indication that you are processing facts in a rational way and indicates that confirmation bias is at work. It's an inherently mocking tone, one that should only be used with clearly unreasonable positions. And treating reasonable positions as unreasonable destroys one's credibility.</p>

<p>I'd approve of a test/liability insurance system for gun regulation, but, only if it was part of a total redesign of the gun regulation system that took way all of the trash gun control laws. But that's not going to happen because a lot of gun control types are just like pro-lifers who realize that they can't outright ban abortion, so they just slam clinics with as much bullshit regulation as possible to make doctors' lives as hard as possible.</p>

Its abstract can be found here <a href="http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2015.302703">http:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>ajph.aphapublications.org/<wbr></wbr>doi/<wbr></wbr>10.2105/<wbr></wbr>AJPH.2015.302703</a>    The thesis of the authors is that the handgun permit-to-purchase law passed in Connecticut in October of 1995 produced a large reduction in the rate of homicides caused by firearms.  They write "We estimated that the law was associated with a 40% reduction in Connecticut’s firearm homicide rates during the first 10 years that the law was in place. By contrast, there was no evidence for a reduction in nonfirearm homicides". The method they use produces an indeterminate result in regards to whether non-firearm homicides increased, or decreased. So, their results are entirely consistent with a situation where the law transferred the weapon used in homicides with little impact on their over all rate., even though a lot of the commentary on the paper (and even the authors themselves to some degree) portray these results as a major facet in the case for gun control</p>

<p>At first glance, there seem to be some major methodological issues with this study. There is, a zone of weaseldom in-between perfectly done and rigorous studies, and outright forgery. And due to some of the previously mentioned issues with this paper, that is what I see this one as.  The first is the paper's total reliance on arbitrary cutoffs. In particular, they (with little explanation) choose 2005 as the end of the date range that they were studying (despite that later data was available from the data set they were using).  It seems that their results are pretty much dependent on that 2005 cutoff. Expanding it to the full dataset, or reducing it to earlier dates, or even moving it forward one year to 2006 totally causes the correlation to break down. They no longer get a p-value less than 0.05.  This is a huge red flag and really reflects negatively on the quality of the whole study. This type of result dependence on a cutoff like that needs a lot of justification ,but all I see is handwaveing. Fortunately, they do adjust for the nationwide trend in reduction in violence, but the fact that there has been a nation wide reduction in gun violence of a similar magnitude brings up issues with causation. There is little direct evidence for causation, and the 30% number seems quite high (particularly when compared to the relatively weak correlation between homicide rates and gun ownership between nations).</p>

<p>I've deployed twitter blocklists (like GG autoblocker, and the A+ blocklist) because I've gotten a bit of trolling because of tweeting about controversial topics (like gamergate). And I'm a man with ~4000 followers. But even despite a smallish audience and my gender, the trolling was annoying enough. And the blocklists shut the trolls up. I'm not totally a fan of them -- the method of adding accounts to the lists seems more aggressive than a Klingon with an anger management problem -- but its better than nothing. Really, these twitter blocklists are like some of the first spam blocklists. Problematic in how they decided to add ip addresses to the killfile, but good enough at killing spammers to make it worth it.</p>
