<p><em>This post is part of a series <a title="Blog Post Series on the History of Sustainable Energy and Climate Change Politics" href="https://theojones.name/index.php/blog-post-series-on-the-history-of-sustainable-energy-and-climate-change-politics/">on the history of the politics of sustainable energy</a> <br /></em>In this post I will discuss the role of the media and the viewpoints of politicians in  forming the public opinion on climate change. Public opinion about climate change has generally been more closely related to the opinions presented in the news media by politicians than the opinions of professional scientists. In 2006, when both political parties were considering climate change action, public belief in the mainstream view of climate science was at its pinnacle. More than 85 percent of the American population believed that humans were causing climate change at that time. [1. <em>See Merchants of Doubt: How a Handful of Scientists Obscured the Truth on Issues from Tobacco Smoke to Global Warming </em> page 169] The most prominent media coverage of the issue was positive towards the mainstream view. The popular documentary, “An Inconvenient Truth,” featuring former vice president and presidential candidate, Al Gore, was released that year and received much positive media coverage. A scientifically implausible, but alarming fictional account of the effects of climate change was brought to the public eye in the 2004 disaster movie, “<em>The Day After Tomorrow.</em>” Then president George W. Bush accepted the existence of human-caused climate change, although he did oppose the Kyoto Protocol agreement and his policy proposals focused on voluntary industry action. After the election of President Obama in 2008, the tone in the media changed. [2. See the book <em>Open for Business: Conservatives’ Opposition to Environmental Regulation</em> for a discussion of the development of right-wing opposition to climate change, the information on the Bush Administration can be found on page 318]. After the election of President Obama in 2008, the tone in the media changed. The Tea Party movement, formed out of a mix of populist New Right fiscal conservatives, libertarians and social conservatives, and this movement made opposition to climate change mitigation and other forms of environmental regulation a core goal [3. Page 2 of <em>Open for Business: Conservatives’ Opposition to Environmental Regulation</em>]. Climate change became a partisan political issue and the media used its informational role in a way that cast public doubt on the fundamentals of the climate issue. It is true that some of this may have been due to the role of controversial political figures in the climate change issue, and the fact that some environmental activists have used the climate change issue to advocate for other weakly related topics. However, the role of a rising conservativism in the climate change issue is certain. The political and inherently controversial nature of solutions to climate change were interwoven and confused with the scientific and factual nature of the problem itself. Politicians not happy with proposed solutions cast doubt on climate change and sowed doubt with the help of the media. Journalists would often balance a climate change interview with a scientist with a politician denying there was a problem. Presenting two unequal sides as similar in merit is not objectivity and it misleads the audience. However, all too often the news media has not taken the time to figure out the scientific boundary of the climate change issue and to acknowledge the difference between fact and fiction.</p>

<p>The possibility that the media has failed to inform the public on the real scientific <br />boundaries of the climate change issue is backed up by data. A 2012 study by progressive advocacy group Media Matters found that between August and November of 2012 (approximately the election season), 72 percent of the people featured in print in climate change stories were politicians and only five percent were climate scientists. In television media, just 6 percent of the guests on climate change stories were scientists.Many publications did not interview any climate experts. The survey found that “<em>ABC, NBC, Fox News, USA Today, The Wall Street Journal, San Jose Mercury News, Las Vegas Review-Journal,Denver Post, Dallas Morning News , the St. Petersburg-Tampa Bay Times, and the Des Moines Register did not interview or quote a single scientist on climate change.</em>”</p>
