<p>The <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/Gamergate" class="p-category" rel="tag">#Gamergate</a> mascot comes from the 4chan "picclo dick" rape joke.<br /><a href="https://www.fastcodesign.com/3037941/the-secret-meaning-behind-gamergates-branding#3" rel="in-reply-to" class="u-in-reply-to">https:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>www.fastcodesign.com/<wbr></wbr>3037941/<wbr></wbr>the-secret-meaning-behind-gamergates-branding#3</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The meme is based around an animated GIF called “Piccolo Dick,” which shows the Dragon Ball anime character Piccolo sodomizing Vegeta, another character from the series. Banned by many internet forums, posters began to abstract the image to the point that the colors alone were easily associated with the meme.....The image first appeared on 4chan in the 2000s and was frequently reposted by forum trolls, who spoke of giving a "daily dose" of the graphic to forum members, who’d then reply with the catchphrase "Thanks, doc," according to the meme encyclopedia Know Your Meme. Soon, the image was banned, and users began to post other purple-and-green images understood to be a reference to the forbidden GIF...... in the initial forum discussion that led to the Vivian James design, a draft of the Vivian character with her distinctive color palette got plenty of "thanks, doc" replies, as did an anonymous illustrator who a few days later posted a first draft of the now standard GamerGate logo, showing a stylized video game controller with purple and green G’s.</p>
