<p><a href="http://www.theojones.name/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/7439512656_04f88d7461_z.jpg"><img src="http://www.theojones.name/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/7439512656_04f88d7461_z.jpg" alt="7439512656_04f88d7461_z" width="640" height="426" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2454"></a>There is another reason to dislike the toxic cloud of sexism that is <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/gamergate" class="p-category" rel="tag">#gamergate</a>. It's totally trashing the reputation of every community it touches. The gaters have reinforced pretty much every negative stereotype about gamers. They have made every gamer look like a doxing and SWATTing idiot. They have created a massive harassment campaign in the name of "protecting" gaming. And all they have done is to damage the reputation of the tech community. Look at anything in the popular press on this issue. Look at this article, for instance <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/culture/2015/06/05/3661042/women-using-gamergate-industry-discrimination-change-tech/"></a><a href="http://thinkprogress.org/culture/2015/06/05/3661042/women-using-gamergate-industry-discrimination-change-tech/" rel="in-reply-to" class="u-in-reply-to">http:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>thinkprogress.org/<wbr></wbr>culture/<wbr></wbr>2015/<wbr></wbr>06/<wbr></wbr>05/<wbr></wbr>3661042/<wbr></wbr>women-using-gamergate-industry-discrimination-change-tech/<wbr></wbr></a>   What is its first example of sexism in tech? <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/gamergate" class="p-category" rel="tag">#gamergate</a> . Incidents like <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/gamergate" class="p-category" rel="tag">#gamergate</a> have made it look like everyone in tech is like the gaters.  It makes us all look like a pack of Neanderthals that was dredged up from the Pleistocene.  The gaters may screech and holler about the so-called "gamers are dead" articles what were published earily in this controversy. But all they have done is prove that gaming will be dead in its current form if it doesn't clean up its toxic community. And gaters and their ilk are at the forefront of the toxic elements of the gamer community. And that's the saddest thing about GG, they have failed by even their own objectives. They have made every issue they claim to care about worse. They have proven to the world that, even their fiercest critics, and the fiercest critics of the gaming community have a point. Its time fight back against GG and its toxic sexism, lest the gaters burn the community to the ground.</p>
