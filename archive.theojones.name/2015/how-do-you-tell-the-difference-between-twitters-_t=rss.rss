<p>How do you tell the difference between Twitter's new killfile options and McCarthyist censorship?  In one Commie McRed was prevented from talking to people who what to hear what he has to say. In the other, Gater McAsshole is being stopped from spewing to a captive audience who doesn't want to listen to him. Freedom of speech doesn't guarantee an audience. There will be people who don't want to hear what you have to say, and its their right to tune you out (as long as they don't try to stop you from reaching those who do want to hear you). McCarthyism was firing people for being part of the communist party. This twitter feature is more like telling your secretary you want all mailings from the communist party thrown away.</p>
