        <p>Pope Francis met with Kim Davis, and in the process killed some <a href="https://twitter.com/VincentHarris/status/649291050067099648">endangered social media feels</a>. I'm with Washington Post <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/30/why-no-one-should-be-surprised-that-pope-francis-met-with-kim-davis/?tid=sm_fb">editorial writer Chris Cillizza on this, why is anyone surprised</a>? </p><p>Its not like the pope kept his opinions on gay marriage a secret. And on a similar note, why do people think that Pope Francis is such a change from previous popes? Other than changing the presentation, he has made minimal changes to catholic doctrine. His opinions on economic issues are the same as most other recent popes, and skepticism about capitalism has been part of the religion for quite a while. And the catholic church is as opposed to gay marriage, and abortion as ever. It is still the same religion as before, only with different packaging. </p><p>And do Davis' opinions and those  of the Pope actually vary that radically? Other than the fact that Davis is a million times more of an asshole about them?</p><p>Consider the following:</p><ul><li>Pope Francis is the monarch of a country that is decidedly not issuing marriage licenses to gay people.</li>
<li>Until a week ago, Davis was a member of the democratic party, so we can at least assume her opinions are at least somewhat moderate on economic issues.</li>
</ul><p>A lot of the sympathy going around towards both individuals is just political signaling. Davis  sends out the conservative political signals, while Francis is associated with liberal ones. Supporters of both follow these signals.</p></div>]]></description>
