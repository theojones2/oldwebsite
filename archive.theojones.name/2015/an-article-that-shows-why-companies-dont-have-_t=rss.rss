<p>An article that shows why companies don't have to file tons of crap lawsuits to keep their trademarks.<br /><a href="http://blog.grabeh.net/The-myth-of-mandatory-trade-mark-enforcement" rel="in-reply-to" class="u-in-reply-to">http:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>blog.grabeh.net/<wbr></wbr>The-myth-of-mandatory-trade-mark-enforcement</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Trade mark disputes pop up all the time. Often it's a David v Goliath affair with a large incumbent with an equally large legal budget seeking to squish to plucky start-up.</p>

<p>In some cases, the Goliath can attempt to use its registered trade marks to oppress an upstart providing goods or services in an area completely unrelated to it. </p>

<p>Some may see this kind of action as completely unreasonable on the basis that there couldn't conceivably be any confusion or intention to take advantage of the reputation of the incumbent.</p>

<p>Others might comment that a trade mark owner is required to enforce their trade marks otherwise risk losing the ability to enforce them in the future or as is sometimes mooted lose the trade mark altogether.</p>
