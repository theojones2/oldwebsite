        <blockquote><p>"Representative Jared Polis took to his hometown paper, The Daily Camera, last week to apologize for his “spectacularly bad idea” that colleges and universities should expel students at the mere accusation of sexual assault, but the fallout for the Boulder, Colorado representative continues. Polis made the comments—which included the assertion that if 10 students were accused of sexual assault and only “maybe one or two did it,” the university should “get rid of all 10”— while questioning FIRE Legislative and Policy Director Joe Cohn at a congressional hearing earlier this month. That statement, which flies in the face of both constitutional due process protections and common sense, has been widely rebuked. Making matters worse for Polis, his mea culpa has been called halfhearted, as it appears to double down on some downright dangerous ideas about due process."</p></blockquote></div>
