        <p>Geoengineering refers to proposals to ameliorate global warming by causing a man-made cooling effect. This may have the potential to blunt some of the more destructive effects of climate change. I'm not entirely opposed to the idea, as it might be good for blunting some of the worse effects of climate change. It is probably better than doing nothing, although is a worse option than keeping emissions at their current rate. It serves as a middle ground between actually dealing with the issue by reducing emissions, and doing noting about the problem. What this post is about is why it isn't a good alternative to emissions reduction.</p><p>The ultimate problem with climate change/global warming isn't that the climate is warming, or even that it is switching to a different climate pattern. The problem is the rate of change at which this is happening. Its that the new climate will have new weather patterns, and that our infrastructure, and the locations of human populations are suited for the old ones. It is even possible that the new weather patterns could be at least as "good" as the old ones. But the problem is the disparity between how our infrastructure and society is set up, and what the climate patterns look like.</p><p>Temperature is one of many variables that sets what the climate and the weather patterns of the world look like. It is the one that is currently being modified by greenhouse gas pollution. Geoengineering will have the effect of adjusting the temperature in a way that offsets the effects of greenhouse gasses on temperature. But, it will also have the effect of modifying other key aspects of the global climate. These modifications mean that we will not end up with the same climate that we had before the introduction of greenhouse gas pollution after geoengineering. The net change may be less drastic. But it will not be non zero. Geoengineering offsets the effects of human activity on one climate variable at the expense of poking at others. This means that we will still have a substantial climate change even after geoengineering.</p><p>What could some of that climate change in a post-geoengineering world look like? A 2009 paper by Robock et al looked at some of those issues (see the end of this post for a full citation). </p><p><a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2009GL039209/full" rel="in-reply-to" class="u-in-reply-to">http:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>onlinelibrary.wiley.com/<wbr></wbr>doi/<wbr></wbr>10.1029/<wbr></wbr>2009GL039209/<wbr></wbr>full</a></p><p>In particular, they looked at one commonly proposed method, stratospheric aerosol injection. They write:</p><blockquote><p>Anthropogenic stratospheric aerosol injection would cool the planet, stop the melting of sea ice and land-based glaciers, slow sea level rise, and increase the terrestrial carbon sink, but produce regional drought, ozone depletion, less sunlight for solar power, and make skies less blue.</p></blockquote><p> </p><p> </p><p><span style="color: #222222; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Robock, Alan, et al.
