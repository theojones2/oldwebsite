    <blockquote><p>"The “solutions” to drug violence permeate the law, and attitudes toward drugs, that grew out of the crack days, from the drug kingpin sentences reflected in the sentencing guidelines to in rem forfeiture, sold as “taking the profit out of crime.” These are monumentally serious issues, given that the number of murders in New York City in 2014 was 328. Clearly, something has changed, given that recent drug crime hasn’t produce a fraction of the violence. Does this matter? You bet it does. It’s critical that judges recognize that the perceived connection between drugs and violence from the bad old days is no longer true, and that defendants sentenced for drug offenses not be viewed through the prism of violence as well. But when the “scholarship” relies on such a mistaken premise, that violence never happened, it’s immediately dismissed."</p></blockquote></div>
