<p>Although I do think that Occam's Razor rules out moral theories that rely on more than a few basic assumptions. So, theories that assume (instead of derive) high-level things like Blackstone's ratio are out. The is-ought problem of turning facts into ethics produces a similar issue to the problem of how to turn observations into facts. For the observation to facts issue I would say that the scientific method is a sufficient solution. (I'm a scientific positivist, so, I think that the scientific method is the only reliable source of factual knowledge.</p>

<p>However, I can't even settle on what the set of assumptions for ethics would be. If you really pressed me on the subject I might be tempted to bring up preference utilitarianism, but I'm not even convinced of that. And/therefore I think there is an even higher level problem. This type of argument (and the whole idea of finding the axioms for morality) assumes moral realism -- the idea that moral truths exist in some form that is independent of the subjective ideas of people. And the more I think about it, I start to come to the opinion that moral realism is probably false. Morality is a human thing, not a fact of the universe.</p>

<p>But that doesn't mean that morality doesn't exist. I would say that it is effectively the product of game theory as applied through a social contract. The alternative is a war of all against all that isn't in the self-interest of anyone.</p>
