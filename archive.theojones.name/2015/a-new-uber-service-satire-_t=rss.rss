<p>Interested in forming your own <strong><em><u>disruptive</u></em></strong> startup? Well, the Uber business seminar is for you. Learn how to <strong><em><u>disrupt</u></em></strong> competitors, consumers and regulators from the founders of Uber --- <em>Ayn Rand’s Favorite Taxi</em>.</p>
<ul><li>Learn how to turn a service that has existed for over a century into a <strong><em><u>disruptive</u></em></strong> Silicon Valley wonder, by doing the same thing, only with a computer. Learn the core of the Uber business model from someone who has practiced it for 20 years – John Smith the taxi driver.</li>
    <li>Learn how to <strong><em><u>disrupt</u></em></strong> regulations regarding your service by pretending that adding a computer means you are doing something different. Learn about the intellectual property applications of this technique from Jack Cheatem, lawyer for many IP litigation companies including Prenda Law, and Intellectual Ventures.</li>
    <li>Learn from the Uber IT team just how little you can spend on computer security without immediate impact. If you follow our method, by the time you get customer data hacked from your insecure servers, you will be a multibillion dollar company that just doesn’t need to care.</li>
    <li>Learn how to <strong><em><u>disrupt</u></em></strong> consumer behavior. Are your users attune to your high prices? Our surge pricing method will fix that. They won’t even realize how much you are charging them.</li>
    <li>Learn how to become a platform not a service. Platforms sound nice and <strong><em><u>disruptive</u></em></strong> and even better, the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">dolts</span> service providers on your platform aren’t your employees, so you don’t have to follow labor law, disability law, anti-discrimination law, or other big government red tape. And even better, the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">dolts</span> service providers on your platform won’t realize how many of your costs you outsourced to them.</li>
    <li>Discuss the books that every business man should read, including, <em>Atlas Shrugged, The Fountainhead,</em> and <em>The Virtue of Selfishness</em>.</li>
    <li>Learn how to apply the Ferengi Rules of Acquisition to your startup.</li>
