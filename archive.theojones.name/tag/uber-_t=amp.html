<p>In one of the few things I will commend them for, Uber has a multi-people per car service in some cities "UberPool" <a href="https://get.uber.com/cl/uberpool/">https:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>get.uber.com/<wbr></wbr>cl/<wbr></wbr>uberpool/<wbr></wbr></a><br />And its a good thing too because the share taxi/jitney is probably the most environmentally friendly form of transit around. If Uber can make such a thing common in the US I may forgive them for the other stuff.</p>

<p><a href="../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/uberharm.jpg.html"><amp-img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2427" src="http://www.theojones.name/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/uberharm.jpg" alt="uberharm" width="640" height="360"></a>Uber recently lost an administrative decision in California over whether their drivers are independent contractors or employees. <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/dandiamond/2015/06/17/if-uber-drivers-are-employees-company-faces-hard-decision-on-health-care/">This could have very important implications for the company</a>. It would mean that the company is bound by a wide variety of regulations that fall on companies that hire employees. Uber would be bound to pay employees the minimum wage (regardless of the number of rides given), health benefits, it would be bound by working hours regulations, and many other regulation. Probably worst of all for the company, Uber would have to cover the business expenses of employees, or at least take them into account in tabulating wages paid. This was not a positive ruling for Uber. But to this outcome, I say it’s about time. Uber's entire business model is to ignore every regulation on their industry to keep costs down. Now, some of these regulations are useless. But Uber throws out the good with the bad. It’s nice to hear that regulators are finally "disrupting" them. Now, I will say that the conventional taxi system is pretty terrible. Where I live there aren't too many outright ripoff cab drivers, but there are ones that are 20 minutes late and which are otherwise unreliable. When you get to larger cities that are more dependent on cabs, it gets even worse some of the problems with cabs across the country is due to shitty regulations (hello, New York City medallion system). I can see why people like Uber and use their products, as they provide a very strong improvement over other taxi networks. However, as I said before they toss out the good with the bad in regards to regulations. In this post I’ll discuss some things I believe solidly that Uber should change with their business model.</p>

<p>The first big issue with Uber is their limited insurance for their drivers. There are very strong reasons why anyone driving for a business should have commercial insurance. Regular car insurance does not cover business driving. However, many of Uber’s drivers are driving illegally without the proper commercial insurance, posing strong legal risk to them, to consumers, and to other motorists. Fortunately, Uber has made some improvements on this issue recently by proving their drivers a limited secondary insurance policy for their Uber driving. But it’s not enough, and the coverage this provides is quite limited and poorly fits the legal requirements on commercial driving. This lack of insurance also serves to externalize costs on to the public. If an Uber driver gets into a car wreck while driving, both the victim of the car accident, and the driver have a huge problem. The driver has a large potential liability, while the victim of the car wreck will be left out to dry. The risk created by driving safety by Uber is unloaded onto the public.</p>

<p>The second major issue with Uber is their pricing scheme. All prices on Uber are set by the company. This is bad, because the price that optimizes Uber profits might not be the socially optimal price. In fact, if you accept Uber’s line that they are just a “platform” for independent contractors then, <a href="http://www.interfluidity.com/v2/5822.html">as the economics blogger Steve Waldman points out</a>, in effect Uber is a price-fixing cartel. A more flexible form of pricing set by the drivers is possible. Also, Uber’s pricing system is highly unstable because their surge level fluctuates a lot. I (along with most consumers I would guess) would prefer a much more predictable pricing system. But congestion pricing isn’t totally useless. It is useful to charge riders more for traveling at rush hour, in order to keep cars available for those who need to travel at that time. An intermediate solution is possible. A revision for Uber’s pricing system would involve the following, allow each driver to set his price for different categories of time (ie. Morning rush hour, evening rush hour, rest of the day, night time) but encourage drivers to refrain from changing their rates too much. This would also mean that all prices are human set, avoiding issues like what happened in Sidney, Australia where <a href="http://gawker.com/uber-turned-on-surge-pricing-for-people-fleeing-sydney-1671193132">Uber surged priced people fleeing a hostage situation</a>.</p>

<p>The third major issue with Uber is their tendency to off load a lot of their costs onto the drivers in a way that is nowhere near transparent. <a href="https://get.uber.com/cl/">Uber’s page recruiting new drivers</a> states, “<em>Got a car? Turn it into a money machine. The city is buzzing and Uber makes it easy for you to cash in on the action. Plus, you've already got everything you need to get started.</em>” An ad bought by Uber on the Bing search engine states that drivers “<em>Make Up To $17/hr In Fares</em>”. Of course, this claimed pay is highly misleading. It doesn’t take into account the cost of car maintenance (which not only increase with respect with miles driven, but also should be put to the higher standards of commercial driving). It also doesn’t take into account the cost of fuel, insurance, or other necessities of driving. Probably, the adjusted pay is more like 8-10 dollars per hour. The IRS estimates (for the purposes of tax deductions) that the <a href="http://www.irs.gov/Tax-Professionals/Standard-Mileage-Rates/">non-labor cost of business miles</a> is 57 cents per mile.</p>

<p>Interested in forming your own <strong><em><u>disruptive</u></em></strong> startup? Well, the Uber business seminar is for you. Learn how to <strong><em><u>disrupt</u></em></strong> competitors, consumers and regulators from the founders of Uber --- <em>Ayn Rand’s Favorite Taxi</em>.</p>
<ul><li>Learn how to turn a service that has existed for over a century into a <strong><em><u>disruptive</u></em></strong> Silicon Valley wonder, by doing the same thing, only with a computer. Learn the core of the Uber business model from someone who has practiced it for 20 years – John Smith the taxi driver.</li>
    <li>Learn how to <strong><em><u>disrupt</u></em></strong> regulations regarding your service by pretending that adding a computer means you are doing something different. Learn about the intellectual property applications of this technique from Jack Cheatem, lawyer for many IP litigation companies including Prenda Law, and Intellectual Ventures.</li>
    <li>Learn from the Uber IT team just how little you can spend on computer security without immediate impact. If you follow our method, by the time you get customer data hacked from your insecure servers, you will be a multibillion dollar company that just doesn’t need to care.</li>
    <li>Learn how to <strong><em><u>disrupt</u></em></strong> consumer behavior. Are your users attune to your high prices? Our surge pricing method will fix that. They won’t even realize how much you are charging them.</li>
    <li>Learn how to become a platform not a service. Platforms sound nice and <strong><em><u>disruptive</u></em></strong> and even better, the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">dolts</span> service providers on your platform aren’t your employees, so you don’t have to follow labor law, disability law, anti-discrimination law, or other big government red tape. And even better, the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">dolts</span> service providers on your platform won’t realize how many of your costs you outsourced to them.</li>
    <li>Discuss the books that every business man should read, including, <em>Atlas Shrugged, The Fountainhead,</em> and <em>The Virtue of Selfishness</em>.</li>
    <li>Learn how to apply the Ferengi Rules of Acquisition to your startup.</li>
