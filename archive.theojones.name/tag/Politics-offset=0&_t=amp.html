This issues is roughly symmetrical on both sides of American politics. Furthermore, this is worse than in the recent past. There are a few sub-issues with in this that I identify</div><ul style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue';"><li>Partisanship </li>
<li>Irreason (science denials, the inability for people to challenge wrong/disingenuous arguments from their own side) </li>
<li>The inability to admit uncertainty in one’s beliefs </li>
<li>The growth of political media outlets — (Fox News, social media, talk radio etc.) </li>
<li>Attacks on important shared values like civil liberties, due process, and freedom of speech.</li>
<li>The end of bipartisan cooperation to meet shared goals</li>
<li>The increasing inability to separate personal, non-political life from politics </li>
<li>Overconfidence — over estimating the probability that one’s ideas are correct</li>
</ul><div style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue';"><strong>The centrism solution </strong>— The idea that the ideas promoted by both sides of American politics are extreme, and the optimal set of policies is roughly in-between the two extremes. </div><div style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue';"> </div><div style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue';">I believe that the increasing toxicity of American politics is a major problem for the country. However, centrism is not the solution to it. The ultimate issue with the current American political situation is the <em>way</em> that political issues are being resolved. It is the political culture where the other side is viewed as the enemy. A threat to be countered before it destroys the real americans. It is the political culture that considers a “safe place” as one in which the other side is not present. It is the red tribe versus blue tribe politics. However, this is not nessarily an issue with the particular policies being promoted. It does not mean that the correct policy is halfway in-between those favored by the typical democrat and those favored by the typical republican. In many cases one side is wrong, and one side is right. Either action needs to be taken on climate change or it does not. The half-way centrist solution may very well be the worse of all options — one that neither side desires, and one that does just enough to incur a lot of costs but not enough to actually fix the climate change issue (think of the introduction of biofuels as a real world example of this). Either gay marriage should be legal or it shouldn’t, and any attempts at half way policies (such as civil unions) are unsatisfactory at best. Either the minimum wage produces dangerous disemployment effects or it doesn’t. And so on. </div><div style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue';"> </div><p> </p><div style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue';">Now, the centrism-as-the-solution idea seems intuitive for a simple reason — in an highly toxic political climate , people will reject the good with the bad from the other side. The mere fact that an idea comes from the other side of the political spectrum (or even attains an association with it) becomes sufficient reason to reject it. The behavior and ideas of one side are given favoritism compared to the ideas from the other side. This may give one the idea that the middle is where the solution can be found. But even though some good conservative ideas may be rejected by liberals and some good liberal ideas may be rejected by conservatives , this does not mean that the correct choice for each issue is the middle. It means that liberals and conservatives should pay attention to each others’ ideas. </div><div style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue';"> </div><div style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue';"><a href="politics.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#politics</a><a href="centrism.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#centrism</a><strong> </strong></div></div>                    </div>

            </p>
            <p>Speaker of the House John Boehner resigned earlier this week, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/dandiamond/2015/09/25/planned-parenthood-fight-costs-john-boehner-his-job/">in part due to the fight over funding for Planned Parenthood</a>.  Incidents like this show something that is fairly obvious to most people, that social issues are among the most persistently toxic issues. But why should abortion, gay marriage, and such be so at the core of U.S politics. Why should they be major litmus tests for both parties? By any reasonable measure these issues are pretty low impact for the level of attention they receive. By impact, they certanily aren’t as important as immigration, climate change, poverty, or other issues that have a very large effect on over all social well being. But there is a dearth of individuals writing flameage about urban planning on social media, nor are there government shutdowns about that topic, despite the fact that urban planning policy probably has a <a href="http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/chang-tai.hsieh/research/growth.pdf">much larger impact on the over-all wellbeing of the typical person </a></p><p>So, why do social issues produce the toxicity that they do? I have a few ideas</p><ul><li>The zero sum nature of them. A loss for one side is a gain for the other. Allowing gay marriage is a victory for those who want gay marriage but a loss those who don’t want it. Defunding Planned Parenthood means a rather direct loss for people who want to keep abortion services available, but it is a rather direct win for those opposed to abortion (ignoring indirect effects of contraceptive avaiability on the number of abortions).</li>
<li>The incommensurability of moral systems. The ethical assumptions that underlie one side <em>make no sense</em> from the other side. From the perspective of a supporter of abortion availability, the arguments of the other side seem like at best mindless superstition, and at worst outright sexism. From the perspective on an abortion opponent the other side seems like a villan from a James Bond movie. Likewise with gay marriage, the “family values” that conservatives are interested in promoting have close to no value to liberals.  This probably by its self produces a lot of the inability for the different sides to deal with each other -- they begin to perceive each other as downright evil. </li>
<li>The role of religion. The U.S is one of the few countries where religion is important enough to have a major political role, but not so powerful to totally dominate politics. This creates the clashes over social issues, as the U.S is really in a transitional point between religion and secularism. The importance of this is obvious from the conservative side, but I think there is a more subtle role here in the politics of the left. A lot of the social justice activism that plays out on social media, and on college campuses, seems to me like a secular substitute for religion — a replacement for its role in society. This would also explain a lot of the uniquely American aspects of these issues.  </li>
<li>The clearly disengenious nature of many of the arguements fronted on these issues. </li>

<p>I've noticed that the hard left has a large amount of opposition to modernism and a good dose of what could be described as reactionaryism (the belief in the return to a past state). Sure, this is commonly (and perhaps almost exclusively) associated with the right-wing, but it's a huge element of some newer left-wing points of view. It's common to view reactionaryism solely in terms of classic social issues, and on these points reactionaryism is an inherently right-wing point of view. But there are other elements of policy and on these it's the left that wants to resist/reverse social progress. Additionally, this is one of the reasons why liberalism is NOT equivalent to progressivism/leftism. It's only an oddity of US politics that has made it seem like this is true. The range of political possibilities in the United States has be limited in such a way as to leave both progressives and liberals in agreement on all major issues of politics. I think this is beginning to change, and there will become an increasingly strong distinction between these two ideologies in the future. I would commit that within the next 10 or so years this will become a very noticeable distinction -- similar to the one that splits conservatives and libertarians. The dispute is fundamentally over the three pillars of enlightenment liberalism 1) science as the arbitrator of knowledge,2) democracy and due process as the arbitrator of political outcomes, and 3) individual liberty. Here are a few of the reactionary tendencies in the left wing viewpoint</p>
<ol><li>A dislike of science. This can be seen in issues like the debate over GMO's and similar conflicts. This can also be seen in the broader world of ideology. The world of left-leaning academic theory is almost overwhelmingly skeptical of the view that human society can be studied scientifically using the (largely quantative) methods commonly associated with the natural sciences. At the very least, this involves an emphasis on "other ways of knowing", and on the self-reported and analyzed "lived experiences" of people. This comes under such names as "structuralism" in the literature. The most extreme form of this comes under such names as post-structuralism and postmodernism and outright disputes the primacy of science even in the realm of the natural sciences, like physics and biology. This is of, course a highly problematic position, but is not at all rare in the world of diversity studies, and other left-leaning elements of the humanities.</li>
<li><p>Persistent clashes with freedom of speech. A lot of members of the modern left don't recognize the liberal distinction between speech and action. They have resurrected the ancient view that offensive speech or an attack on personal honor is an equivalent to physical violence. They act as if the advocacy of a course of action, or the belief that a course of action is within one's rights, or the attempt to participate in the political process, is equivalent to actually doing the action in question. This treatment of disagreeable speech as an equivalent of a physical attack also materializes into things like "trigger warnings" and the "safe place" movement. This bodes poorly for the underlying conception of democracy. Democracy feeds on public contestability and public debate of possible options. The vast majority of policy proposals will prove to be wrongheaded, and will be rightly rejected. But the process of free discourse and debate is absolutely essential to this process. Enlightenment civic republicanism came into existence in about the same time as science, because the two are innately linked. Both rely on decentralized finding of knowledge. In the case of science, this is for finding facts, in the case of democracy this is for determining how to run society. An attack on free speech is a full scale attack on both.</p></li>
<li><p>A neo-luddite view of technology and industrialization. Widespread industrialization and deployment of technology has vastly improved the standard of living of the typical person. However, many elements of the hard left want to return to a "small is beautiful" way of running the economy. An emphasis is put on small businesses and cooperatives. Some want a small scale and decentralized economy that looks a lot like the pre-industrial world. Its states' rights for progressives. And equally absurd. Despite its flaws, major firms can put in place a large degree of economic planning and stability that smaller firms cannot. They can leverage economies of scale, and they have vast efficiency improvements over smaller firms when they produce a uniform product Small is not efficient.</p></li>

<p>A lot of people try to pretend that censorship is something that can only exist when done by governments, that private actors cannot affect free speech in any meaningful way. This is absurd in my point of view. A right does not meaningfully exist if it cannot be effectively exercised. And private actors can easily put restraints on speakers that can make it very difficult to effectively participate<a href="../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/3992988737_bebac07fb4_b.jpg.html"><amp-img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2451" src="http://www.theojones.name/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/3992988737_bebac07fb4_b-300x189.jpg" alt="3992988737_bebac07fb4_b" width="300" height="189"></a> in politics or partake in free speech. The "freedom of speech isn't freedom of consequences" rejoinder that is commonly heard on internet debates isn't much better either. All censorship works by imposing consequences. The question on free speech is simply, what consequences are acceptable. On the other extreme, there are a lot of people who seem to act like that all criticism of a work they like is an attempt at censorship. This is at the very least a self-contradictory (although there is the easy to over-apply aside that an overly toxic social attitude towards a set of idea can make it very difficult to express them). A much better boundary for free speech versus censorship would be external versus internal consequences. An external consequence on speech is one that occurs through a factor other than the direct market for a work. An internal one comes from the market for the work, and the response from consumers to it. External consequences are often censorship, while internal ones are very rarely censorship. Examples of external consequences would include classic government censorship, threats to unrelated employment, harassment (i.e. SWATing, doxxing, etc.), deprivation of a resource that is generally available to all comers, attempts to pressure a publisher to drop a work by targeting unrelated ones, and so on. The problem with such external consequences comes from my belief that it is fundamentally problematic to use power gained in unrelated markets to muscle one's way into an advantageous position in the marketplace of ideas. Idea and art should rise and fall on their own terms, not the terms of who has the most power in society. It's a similar issue to anti-trust efforts. It is unjust for a company to use its power in one sector of the economy to blast out otherwise viable competitors in other sectors. A focus on external consequences as the demarcating like explains clearly why a lot of things are extremely problematic. Campaigns to target the employment of those with disfavored views (like what occurred in the Brendan Eich controversy) are unethical. <a href="gamergate.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#gamergate</a> style harassment campaigns against people speaking disfavored views are unethical. Campaigns to get stores to drop disfavored works by boycotting unrelated products are problematic (like the one that recently hit Target over the Grand Theft Auto video game). Attempts to pressure providers of generally available services like Facebook and Twitter to drop unpopular speakers are cases of censorship, Internal consequences would include the loss of market for a work due to consumer distaste, and regular editorial discretion by publishers. They are unavoidable and not necessarily unethical.</p>

<p>A beef of mine in the world of politics is the rise of ideologies that are just apriori hairballs. They try to get high level claims from logical deduction with little input from outside facts or data. Examples would be the "praxology" or Austrian school libertarians (and other related ideologies like that of Ayn Rand), many religions, and the type of third wave feminism seen on Tumblr.  But this type of deductive analysis never works for something as complex as human society. You get conflicts with the factual world quite a bit, and many conflicts with science (see libertarian climate change deniers, or "postmodernism/poststructuralism" in the feminist world). Ideally, a political philosophy should instead bridge the is-ought gap with the fewest assumptions possible and from then on rely to the fullest extent possible on scientifically knowable results about the economy and society.</p>

<p>In my previous posts on the Indiana RFRA, I focused on some of the misconceptions going around about what the law actually is about. Now, with that issue cleared up, I will discuss why I think that the RFRA legislation is a bad idea. Now, there are some reasons why exempting people who disagree with a law from it whenever reasonably practical might seem attractive. However, I contend that the practical issues with such a rule end up making it fundamentally unworkable. Furthermore I have some more general conceptual issues the idea behind the law. My first objection to it, is about how the law favors religious objections to legislation over secular ones this is fundamentally unfair the nonreligious individuals who might have an objection to a law that does not involve religious belief. The second objection is to the legal standard the RFRA uses to evaluate potential requests for exemptions-taken at its face it's much too strong and lets in too many objections that interfere with the public purpose. The third objection is fundamentally the bureaucratic hassle involved in evaluating such requests even a more lax standard for evaluating objections to laws will require creating many special situations for people. This will bring the associated paperwork bureaucratic tangle that one would expect from such a situation. Finally, proposed ways to patch the law, such as ruling out the ability for corporate entities to claim exemptions (even when owned by individuals of uniform belief), will fundamentally not work to resolve the issues involved will bring their own issues. Now, I will say, this issue brings up complicated trade-offs inverse rest of this post I will try to give the opposing side its due, and I will look at some of their arguments. I hope you will find his explanation my opinion to be reasonably balanced and take opposing arguments is having some degree of credibility-even if I express fundamental disagreement.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>An editorial by Daniel O. Conkle published March 26 <a href="http://www.indystar.com/story/opinion/readers/2015/03/07/indiana-needs-religious-freedom-legislation/24477303/">defends the Indiana law on the grounds that it allows the protection</a> of "religious believers of all faiths by granting them precisely the same consideration [as the federal RFRA provides]. He notes that the level of scrutiny provided for in the law has served to provide some potentially useful protections of the rights of religious groups.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36pt;"><em>Applying this test, a unanimous U.S. Supreme Court recently ruled that a Muslim prisoner was free to practice his faith by wearing a half-inch beard that posed no risk to prison security. Likewise, in a 2012 decision, a court ruled that the Pennsylvania RFRA protected the outreach ministry of a group of Philadelphia churches, ruling that the city could not bar them from feeding homeless individuals in the city parks.
</em></p><p style="margin-left: 36pt;"><em>…..
</em></p><p style="margin-left: 36pt;"><em>In any event, most religious freedom claims have nothing to do with same-sex marriage or discrimination. The proposed Indiana RFRA would provide valuable guidance to Indiana courts, directing them to balance religious freedom against competing interests under the same legal standard that applies throughout most of the land.
</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/03/29/1374196/-The-Strange-Career-of-RFRA">A writer on the liberal website Daily Kos likewise says that</a> the history of the law comes from a strong intent to protect the rights of religious miniorities, and to defend separation of church and state. Treating the right to free exercise of religion as strongly as other rights furthers this goal in the author's opinion.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36pt;"><em>As long as laws were facially neutral, i.e., were not targeting or singling out particular religious groups for discrimination, then a law which indirectly restricted or burdened a religious practice was/is constitutional. Scalia replaced the Sherbet test of "compelling interest and strict scrutiny" with a "no coercion" test. If your religious practice is accidentally harmed by a facially neutral law that is not intended to coerce or punish your religious group, tough shit.</em>
<em>People were outraged and the outrage spanned the political spectrum of the early 1990s. Strict separation groups like the ACLU, Americans United, the BJCPA, and the People for the American Way made common cause with the Catholic Bishops, the American Jewish Congress, the Christian Legal Society (a very conservative group) and many others to craft the Religious Freedom Restoration Act which was designed to restore the strict scrutiny and compelling interest tests at the federal level
</em></p><p style="margin-left: 36pt;"><em>….
</em></p><p style="margin-left: 36pt;"><em>Without Sherbet [v. Verner – a case setting a similar standard to the one found in RFRAs], one gets a form of secular society more like France's (e.g. where one can ban wearing of religious symbols) than the "benevolent neutrality" that has always been the American tradition.
</em></p>
<p><a href="http://wthitv.com/2015/03/27/one-indiana-state-representative-sits-down-with-news-10-to-explain-his-vote-for-rfra/">A member of the Indiana legislature had the following to say in favor of the law</a>:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36pt;"><em>First and foremost, what does RFRA do? It establishes a judicial standard of review that will provide the courts with clear guidance on how to resolve any matters that come forth surrounding religious freedom. RFRA protects the rights of everyone, regardless of their religious affiliation or lack thereof. This bill is about prohibiting a governmental entity from substantially burdening a person's exercise of religion. It only applies to government action, not citizen to citizen.
</em></p><p style="margin-left: 36pt;"><em>A quick example, in 2012 a court determined that RFRA protected the outreach ministry of a group of Philadelphia churches, ruling that the city could not bar them from feeding homeless individuals. Along with practical examples, it is equally important to look at the history behind RFRA.
</em></p>
<p>However with the clear good at such laws have provided on some points there is substantial possibility for negative outcomes. And on its surface test the RFRA demands is exceedingly harsh. Probably legitimate claims such laws been known to bring in frivolous or at least highly dubious ones. The only reason we haven't seen the worst of what that standard truly means that courts have implicitly watered it down to a much more reasonable one. Doing so, courts have probably saved the legislature from itself. But, one should take a moment to think what the standard entailed by the plain language of RFRAs would entail if taken seriously. In <em>Employment Division v. Smith</em> (the case which RFRAs are primarily meant to reverse) the Court said the following:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36pt;"><em>The "compelling government interest" requirement seems benign, because it is familiar from other fields. But using it as the standard that must be met before the government may accord different treatment on the basis of race, see, e.g., Palmore v. Sidoti, or before the government may regulate the content of speech, see, e.g., Sable Communications of California v. FCC, is not remotely comparable to using it for the purpose asserted here. What it produces in those other fields -- equality of treatment, and an unrestricted flow of contending speech -- are constitutional norms; what it would produce here -- a private right to ignore generally applicable laws -- is a constitutional anomaly.
</em></p><p style="margin-left: 36pt;"><em>… The rule respondents favor would open the prospect of constitutionally required religious exemptions from civic obligations of almost every conceivable kind -- ranging from compulsory military service to the payment of taxes to health and safety regulation such as manslaughter and child neglect laws, compulsory vaccination laws, drug laws, and traffic laws; to social welfare legislation such as minimum wage laws, child labor laws, animal cruelty laws, environmental protection laws, and laws providing for equality of opportunity for the races.
</em></p>
<p>The only reason that the disaster posed in that opinion did not occur that the courts corrected for the flaw by, at least de facto, substituting the standard stated in the federal RFRA a much more lenient and reasonable one. As the RFRA has been applied, the strict scrutiny stated in the law, has been converted into something that looks a lot more like weaker standards like intermediate scrutiny. However, this workaround is not neutralized the threat that putting such a harsh standard the law poses. Strict scrutiny the legal standard used in a lot of areas; such as free speech law and privacy law. When courts out of necessity say something is the least restrictive means to meeting a compelling need in order to accommodate a malformed law passed by Congress, the application of that standard is undermined in all areas of law.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In my opinion, another critical flaw of RFRAs is that they favor religion over non-religion by allowing for exemptions based on religious grounds but not allowing for exemptions based on secular beliefs. I haven't been able to find the proponent of the law attempts to seriously justify this element of the law. It makes little sense to give a religious exemption, but not an exemption to someone who has a secular objection. In fact, I would argue that, if anything, it should be the secular exemptions to get degree of priority-as these tend to be the ones that have the highest chance based on some grounds that are widely justifiable and contestable based on shared values. Belief that comes from musings about what a sky fairy wants, have a much lower chance of being based on publicly contestable and justifiable values.</p>
<p>A common suggestion to fix some of the deficiencies of the law is to remove reginition of corporations as eligible for protection under RFRAs – with the argument that the problems come from applying it to businesses. The above mentioned Daily Kos article elaborates on this position</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36pt;"><em>In all this legal history, there is no mention of allowing businesses to discriminate on which customers to serve. There is no targeting of LGBTQ persons or Muslims or women trying to fill birth control prescriptions, etc. RFRA and its state counterparts were designed to stop a majoritarian minded SCOTUS and overreaching government from restricting religious practices--usually practices by minority groups overlooked by majorities. RFRA and its state clones were supposed to be protections for relatively powerless groups, not weapons by powerful groups against vulnerable individuals. So, what happened?
</em></p><p style="margin-left: 36pt;"><em>…..
</em></p><p style="margin-left: 36pt;"><em>The other start to this strange twist was Citizens United because, even though the case was about campaign finance regulations, the SCOTUS ruled that corporations are persons and entitled to free speech protection. Then the Hobby Lobby case extended this "logic" further, allowing a business to have a religious liberty claim--when never before in this country had "religious liberty" meant an employer's liberty to impose his/her religious convictions on employees (If my employer is a Jehovah's Witness, can s/he now deny blood transfusions in my health coverage because of his/her religious belief?) or customers.
</em></p>
<p>This point of view is pretty counterfactual as to the actual role of corporate personhood in the law. It is not something that originated with the citizens untied case, and goes as far back as the 1800s. Furthermore, not all of the issues with RFRAs, or even the most severe issues with the concept behind them come from its applications to businesses. As I explained to some degree in the last post on the RFRA, courts are pretty unlikely to apply it in a way that allows for discrimination. And even the Hobby Lobby case was not as huge a problem as it would seem at first glance. And the HL case isn't an example of it being a huge problem there was an easy workaround to that ruling. Funny accounting. And that is what the HHS eventually did to deal with the issue. But the HL case does illustrate the real issue with RFRAs -- that it will mandate special work abounds that consume a lot of administrative effort. HL got an arrangement where the insurance company uses non-HL money to pay for the birth control and uses HL money to pay for non-birth control treatment for other people than HL employees. Waste of time bullshit. And RFRAs are good at generating circumstances that require that type of pointless work around. But there isn't going to be any disastrous outcomes, just a large number of minor annoyances. The hugely problematic issues come from lone individuals. One of the precursors of the Indiana RFRA was a law providing for religious exemptions to vaccinations. Also inherent in this type of argument seems to be the thought that it is impossible for anyone with a problematic religious view to use a wide grant of exemption in an adverse way.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">Well, the Indiana RFRA (Religious Freedom Restoration Act) passed. The whole debate on that legislation could easily be summed up by the Internet meme that says "the amount of energy to refute bullshit is an order of magnitude to bigger then to produce it".</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><amp-img src="http://www.theojones.name/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/032915_0751_OntheRecent1.jpg" alt=""></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The bill provides that religious belief exempts one from regulations, even neutral ones, unless the government produces a compelling need. Neither the Indiana bill nor its federal twin are particular to any type of regulation – and don't mention anti-discrimination issues. Probably 90% of the arguments from both sides in this issue are blatant nonsense. From some Internet discussions you would think people are talking about a different law. The opposition side produces bleating about the law being "a right to discriminate" law. The description of what they mean often has as little to do with the actual legislation, as screeching about how Obama care brings death panels. Especially considering that none of the 19 states that have almost identical legislation have ever granted an exemption to an antidiscrimination law based on a RFRA. It is extremely unlikely that the law will affect anti-discrimination law in any meaningful way. The side in favor of the law usually isn't much better. These people seem to think that religious freedom is under imminent attack. And even worse are the outright homophobic bigots who see in this law a chance that they will be able to do what they want. I have seen very few people discussing this bill who have shown the slightest bit of understanding of it. And even fewer people who have read it. Some of the actual issues brought up by the bill (which for various reasons I strongly disagree with) found to what extent religious exemptions be given to neutral laws are rarely discussed in any coherent degree. The whole debate is dominated by pure bullshit. The whole debate is just nonsense, and people who seem to be immune to logical or rational argument arguing with each other. And with this type of issue anything resembling actual argument doesn't last long against the backdrop of screeching howler monkeys.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">There are a lot of reasons to oppose RFRAs, but as far as I can tell the gay-rights stuff and anti-discrimination law stuff has little to do with the actual law (<a href="https://iga.in.gov/static-documents/9/2/b/a/92bab197/SB0101.05.ENRS.pdf">go read it, a lot of the media coverage on the subject is pretty misleading about the actual content</a>) -- unless the interpretation of the Indiana law differs radically from the interpretation of nearly identical laws in both federal law and the RFRAs in about a dozen other states. And despite that RFRAs have been on the books for about 20 years, no-one has been able to produce a non-overturned case where a RFRA weakened anti-discrimination law. In fact, courts have generally ruled that anti-discrimination passes strict scrutiny, making RFRAs irrelevant. And where the hell did the conception of this bill as an anti-gay one even come from? I don't really know. I think at least some of the proponents are under the impression that it will allow for exemptions to anti-discrimination laws and support it in part for that reason. I think some of the rage came from that (is public accommodation discrimination against gays even a thing? I haven't heard many real cases of it happening). And then there was the Arizona RFRA-ish bill which was really a stealth discrimination bill. If anyone has a good explanation for that tell it to me. This legislation is likely not just a useless repetition of current law. It goes far beyond what the Constitution mandates and even with the federal RFRA, a state RFRA has some effect. In City of Boerne v. Flores the Supreme Court struck down the part of the federal RFRA that applies to the states. But panicking over a state RFRA is a bit too much because we have a decade's worth of litigation over its federal version and good caselaw on what it means.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Neither the Indiana bill nor its federal twin are particular to any type of regulation and include pretty much all of law. I don't think either the federal RFRA or its state versions are a good idea. The idea of religious exemptions from neutral laws is almost always a bad idea. But that isn't what the discussion of the law seems to be focusing on. As I said before<a href="https://iga.in.gov/static-documents/9/2/b/a/92bab197/SB0101.05.ENRS.pdf">, this is a good issue to actually read the bill on, and to read</a> (or at least Wikipedia) some of the relevant court opinions. The bill is only four generously spaced pages long. The religious should not be exempted from neutral laws on the basis of religious belief and I oppose it. The Supreme Court has made it pretty clear that that the First Amendment does not allow people to ignore neutral laws on the basis of religious belief (with a handful of exceptions). See, for example, <em>Employment Division v. Smith</em>. The goal of RFRAs is to override that ruling (the federal RFRA was actually spawned by that ruling) and make actions conducted as a product of religious belief protected. Now, I strongly believe that SCOTUS got it right in Smith, and that RFRAs are fundamentally a bad idea, but the final decision belongs with the legislative branch. Lets look at what the 11-section Indiana bill (which is likely to pass) actually says as I go through a brief summary</p><p style="text-align: justify;">•Section 1: Says that the bill applies to all government laws and regulations, even ones made prior to the enactment of it.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">•Section 2: Only regulations particularly exempted by law are exempt.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">•Section 3: Definitions. Says that regulators are not allowed to use unconstutional provisions to work around the bill with particular mention of the establishment clause of the first amendment.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">•Section 4: More definitions. Pretty obvious and straightforward stuff.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">•Section 5. Defines "exercise of religion" as "any exercise of religion, whether or not compelled by, or central to, a system of religious belief".</p><p style="text-align: justify;">•Section 6: Defines "government entity".</p><p style="text-align: justify;">•Section 7: Defines "Person", includes corporations, but so does the federal RFRA. This right here is a good point to emphasize quite a bit. On internet forms I've seen a number of people who seem to think one of the defining characteristics of this RFRA versus the federal version, or the version in other states, is corporate personhood. It is not true. Like most other federal laws the federal RFRA relies on the Dictionary Act for its definition of "person". The dictionary act quite explicitly defines person to include corporations. <a href="http://www.yalelawjournal.org/forum/hobby-lobby-and-the-dictionary-act">Courts have ruled that no other part of the law overrides that</a>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">•Section 8: States that a governmental entity may not substantially burden a person's exercise of religion unless it meets strict scrutiny. (it's worth noting that the way that courts have actually ruled in regards to RFRAs makes the standard a lot more like intermediate scrutiny).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">•Section 9: People can sue over violations of the law.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">•Section 10: Government agencies can be ordered to pay damages to those affected.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">•Section 11: The bill does not limit the actions of private actors, only government actions, laws and regulations.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Section 8 is the core of the bill and most of the definition sections are mostly boilerplate. Section 8 is almost word for word identical to its counterpart in the federal RFRA.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In a follow up post, I will discuss some reasons why it is a dubious idea to grant religious exemptions to neutral laws and then I will discuss why it is extremely unlikely that the RFRA will ever be interpited to allow for discrimination.</p><p><a href="dictionaryact.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#dictionaryact</a> <a href="firstamendment.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#firstamendment</a> <a href="politics.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#politics</a> <a href="rfra.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#rfra</a> <a href="scotus.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#scotus</a></p></div>                    </div>

<p>The conservative website Red State recently published an editorial about the Department of Justice report on the Ferguson Police Department. Although Red State is the type of place I generally consider unreliable, (however, liberal sites like Daily Kos have also been pretty good BS sources on this topic) the article sums up the topic pretty well, and explains why some of FPD's actions are of concern. <br /><a href="http://www.redstate.com/2015/03/15/many-conservatives-blowing-it-ferguson-doj-report/"></a><a href="http://www.redstate.com/2015/03/15/many-conservatives-blowing-it-ferguson-doj-report/">http:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>www.redstate.com/<wbr></wbr>2015/<wbr></wbr>03/<wbr></wbr>15/<wbr></wbr>many-conservatives-blowing-it-ferguson-doj-report/<wbr></wbr></a></p>

<p>It’s unfortunate, the way news is consumed and interpreted in the age of twitter. Everyone feels tremendous pressure to form an opinion quickly and state it loudly and with certainty. Once this has been done, people are highly resistant to changing their minds and they become impervious to new evidence, often dismissing out of hand outright facts just because they are reported by a given source (e.g., “the media is untrustworthy” or “you can’t trust the Holder Department of Justice.”) Perhaps nowhere has this phenomenon been more obvious (or regrettable) than in Ferguson, Missouri, in the wake of the shooting death of Michael Brown. Interpreting the news out of Ferguson has become a part of ideological tribalism in which, if you are a conservative you stand for the Ferguson PD and if you are a liberal you stand against them. Thus, liberals have become highly resistant to assimilating information that strongly suggests that “hands up, don’t shoot” never happened. Conservatives, on the other hand, have become highly resistant to assimilating information that strongly suggests that the Ferguson PD – as with many other municipal police departments in the country – truly is out of control, in that it recklessly violates the constitutional rights of the citizens of Ferguson and does so in a manner that has a clearly disproportionate impact on minorities.</p>

<p>There have been a number of cases recently where bakeries have been sued for refusing to provide cakes adjusted for gay weddings (i.e with two male figurines, or with appropriate phrasing of text).   Recently <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/01/21/denver-bakery-anti-gay-cake-_n_6516674.html">there also was a mirror image case</a> wherein a bakery refused to letter a cake with a religious anti-gay message. There is a bit of a point to those who object to this type of complaint, the service like a bakery or the like young something that is art are very close to art. Artists can express in their work, it does some pretty gnarly issues with freedom of speech and censorship. However, there is also a need for universal access to business services. Decision has been something quite a bit conflicted about since I've heard about it in previous incidents where this type of issue has come up. And really it comes down to how much of an artistic expression is in the final work. Closer things get to pure are the strong degree of creativity more there is to problems of freedom of expression and censorship. Pretty much what I think is the cutoff should be at where there's a substantial amount of creativity added. Think enough added actual creativity for a new work the baker or whatever creates to be eligible for copyright. And what I've come to realize is that just transcribing some text given to you by a customer doesn't really add much creativity. That makes it so it's really the same product is the same cake only with a different text. Businesses should generally be obligated to serve everyone in the community.It was something else like an artist, or a photographer, or such I would still feel different. Fact that they are concerns over freedom of expression thoroughly dismissed in this issue is more concerning a lot of the discrimination is trying to be combated. In fact, I would say that this might be symptomatic in general a retreat by the left from freedom of speech and civil liberties. Because it is close to undeniable that the closer attempts to eliminate discrimination to work of artists creative workers the more the severe issues with reductions in freedoms caused by the regulations become. Policymakers and commentators should not ignore those issues. Like many issues in politics there are trade-offs involved between different freedoms, and those trade-offs need to be weighed fairly, not completely dismissed.</p>

<p><amp-img align="left" src="http://www.theojones.name/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/011315_0655_ReligionsSh1.jpg" alt=""><span style="font-size:14pt">With the aftermath of the shootings at the office of the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, there seems to be a number of people on social media, and on <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/01/10/1356555/-On-not-being-Charlie">left-wing websites like Daly Kos</a> who seem to think the religion should be beyond criticism and mockery. One thing to note, is that contrary to what many of our friendly social justice warriors have said (Yes, I know that talking of SJWs gets a strong response, but that phrase contains the right level of derision for this dumb idea),the magazine in question is not an extremist or racist one and is well within the mainstream of French politics. The magazine has received many awards for its work and its authors are <a href="http://www.cpj.org/blog/2015/01/charlie-hebdo-attack-unites-france-on-free-express.php">well known and respected within the French journalism community</a>.  As the image to the right shows, the mockery towards religion published by those journalists is nondenominational as many major religions get their dose of mockery from Charlie Hebdo. Perhaps it is true that the authors were trolling Islamic extremists to some extent by publishing cartoons of the Prophet. But that does not make the magazine unacceptably racist. Instead of in opposition to racism, but many of the critics the magazine are instead proposing is that religion should be immune from criticism. That religion is something above other ideologies of beliefs should be treated specially. Religion is treated as some type of immutable characteristic of a person like sex or race. Therefore is street is something that is beyond criticism that any dislike of a given religion amounts to bigotry. This is the same sentiment that got political comedian Bill Maher into trouble after criticizing the growth of Islamic extremism in Europe. The thing is religion should not be treated differently than any other community or ideology or belief system. A religion is just an ideology and belief system with sky fairies. Perhaps it is true that criticism of Islam gets used as a cover for actual anti-Arab racists but, that does not mean that there is no such thing as legitimate criticism of the religion and the rising extremism within it. It is also true that rising immigration into Europe from many authoritarian countries has created new type of resident of Europe, and has created a population of many people dispute fundamental tenants of free and democratic society. <a href="http://www.inquisitr.com/1743767/bill-maher-refuses-to-lay-off-islam-slings-more-insults-on-his-own-show/">As was noted in the controversial edition of Bill Maher's show</a>, almost a quarter of British Muslims believe that the government should execute individuals who have converted away from Islam. This type of extremist ideology certainly deserves all the mockery in criticism that can receive. However many people prefer to deny that it exists at all. These people prefer to believe that terrorism is due to a few lone wolf extremists. Islam in general deserves some criticism for creating an environment where extremism is part of the mainstream. It's a lot like the <a href="GamerGate.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#GamerGate</a> stuff I have discussed earlier in this blog. It's clear that an unusual amount of sexism in toxicity has come from the gaming community compared to other similarly sized Internet communities. And likewise is clear that Islam produces lot more extremism than other major world religions. As Bill Maher put it on a recent episode: <em>"Obviously, the vast majority of Muslims would never do anything like this, But they share bad ideas. This is the thing that caused the big ruckus when Ben Affleck was here. Sam Harris said, 'Islam is the motherlode of bad ideas,' and everyone went fucking nuts on this side of the panel. But it is. These two guys who shot up the cartoonists the other day, they were avenging the prophet, they said? A bad idea. Martyrdom? A bad idea. Women as second-class citizens? A bad idea. And unfortunately, the terrorists and the mainstream share a lot of these bad ideas.</em>" People rightfully saw the error in buuut…  <a href="NotAllGamers.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#NotAllGamers</a>. Sure there are plenty of gamers who are not sexist trogs, but their community is a magnet for problem types. Now see the same with religion. </span></p>
