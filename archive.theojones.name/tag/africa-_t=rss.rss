<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I am strongly against the wider deployment of biofuels. There are the obvious interactions between biofuel production and food prices, and biofuel production is largely responsible for the 2007 price crisis. Other than the large-scale humanitarian reasons to oppose biofuel production as a serious alternative energy, there is also the fact that even considering very generous projections, the fuel source is unlikely to ever produce a large amount of the world's energy supply. Compared to the land they take up, plants are just extremely efficient energy producers. This blog post will show how is simply not possible with anything like current technology to meet even a substantial amount of the world's energy needs with biofuels. I will start with a generous estimate of the maximum possible biomass energy production come out of agricultural land. First are some quick assumptions. The first is that world's future energy supply will need to provide a developed nation level of energy use to a population of about 9 billion people. Furthermore, this will at the very least require power production amounting to about 5000 W per person on average. The current US power consumption amounts to about 10,000 W on average. Now let's calculate based on highly favorable assumptions how much of the world's energy supply biomass energy could reasonably provide.<br /></span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Let's first start the total surface area of the Earth, <a href="http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhypertextbook.com%2Ffacts%2F2001%2FDanielChen.shtml&date=2015-05-24">which is about 361,800,000 square kilometers</a>. How much of this is reasonably available to agriculture? Only 150,000,000 square kilometers is land and only some of this land is actually useful for agriculture. So when you adjust you get a total useful percentage of the Earth's land surface area of <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v461/n7263/full/461472a.html">about 15%</a>. Now, that estimate, would result in estimate of global available crop land of substantially less than half a hectare, or about 1 acre of cropland per person. However, that estimate is based on many environmental constraints. Let's ignore them. The purpose of this article let's pretend we want to maximize biofuel production regardless of any environmental constraints, even if it means destroying almost every natural ecosystem around. Let's pave over every roughly arable plot of land. When you subtract out on the uninhabitable land or land is otherwise useless to large-scale agriculture and divide by the future expected population of 9 billion, <a href="http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.zo.utexas.edu%2Fcourses%2FTHOC%2Fland.html&date=2015-05-25">you get an area of about one hectare (~2 acres) of land per person</a>. If all this land were converted to biofuel production, how much energy could it produce? Of course, this will be a highly generous estimate. One hectare is 10,000 square meters. How much energy do biofuel crops produced per square meter? Depends on the crop. <a href="http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.withouthotair.com%2FcD%2Fpage_284.shtml&date=2015-05-25">Corn grown in the United States converted to ethanol produces about 0.02 watts of energy per square meter</a>. When scaled up across the per-person hectare, this amounts to about 200W per person. This is a straight up puny amount of energy production compared to the total world needs. What about improved technology? The previous link suggests that theoretical cellulosic ethanol system could deliver about 0.2 watts per square meter. This gives a somewhat reasonable contribution to overall energy production. However, such a large number as a product of a very generous estimate, and predicts some technology that only exists on paper. And remember, that per person amount is based on an assumption where all reasonably useful land is being devoted voted to the purpose. Already, most reasonably usable agricultural land is already being used for food production. From page 21 of<br /></span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 36pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong><em>About 12 % of the global land surface is currently under crop cultivation (Foley et al., 2005; Ramankutty et al. 2008). The allowed 3 % expansion (approximately 400 Mha) to the level we propose as a land system boundary will most likely be reached over the coming decades,and includes suitable land that is not either currently cultivated or is under forest cover – e.g., abandoned cropland in Europe, North America and the former Soviet Union and some areas of Africa's savannas and South America's cerrado
</em></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Overall, is clear that, at least with current technology biofuels will be extremely unlikely to provide a substantial contribution to the overall substantial energy production. The current programs of subsidies for biofuel production should be immediately phased out. It will be extremely unlikely to contribute to a substantial energy future. In the meantime, biofuel production will compete with food production while producing very little economic value. Because of this competition with food production and because of the tendencies for this competition increase prices and inflation, I furthermore think that even privately funded biofuel production should be outlawed on any commercial, near commercial, or industrial scale. The small scale production that does continue should be heavily regulated, should be forced to use feed stocks that have no risk of competition with food supplies, and should be heavily taxed (due to the imperfections of regulation in catching all unwanted use of the tech). </span></p>
