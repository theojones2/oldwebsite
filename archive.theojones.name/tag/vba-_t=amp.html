Its one defining  feature is its friendliness to trolls, and its extremely lax , anything goes moderation policy. Among the more notable members of this community are a large part of the active members of <a href="GamerGate.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#GamerGate</a>, focused around the /<a href="http://8ch.net/gamergate/index.html">gamergate</a>/ board. However, there is a much more nefarious board, /<a href="http://8ch.net/baphomet/index.html">baphomet</a>/. That board has the purpose of a clearing house for doxing, harassment, trolling, and hacking. Its members care little for trivial things like ethics. The rules for the board note that "If you have remorse for you're  [sic] actions you are not welcome ….We never show mercy during raids " and  "so if you're a attention whoring faggot this is not the place for you".  /Baphomet/ was founded by trolls and script kiddies saddened by the switch of focus of the hacking group Anonymous towards activism and away from nefarious destruction. Many members of the /gamergate/ chan are also /Baphomet/ users.  There is a close relationship between the two boards. /gamergate/ is the clean board that provides a respectiable public image for GG. /Baphomet/ has become the home for GG dirty tricks. Want to know what GG is really like? Lets  look into /baphomet/ a bit more <a href="http://8ch.net/baphomet/index.html"></a><a href="http://8ch.net/baphomet/index.html">http:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>8ch.net/<wbr></wbr>baphomet/<wbr></wbr>index.html</a> Note that /baphomet/ is just behind /gamergate/ on the top 25 list of 8chan fora.

[and some c++, but not enough to really do anything with…]

<span style="font-size:14pt">I would like to be more of a menace to SJWs, but I'm a kidiot loser who doesn't know how to program anything more complex than a VBA macro. Some are making more progress on the whole being criminals thing.

If it will be particularly funny, they're welcome to come ask us to help out, but if it looks like it's going to be a bore, or if it isn't funny but is simply a matter of supporting an abstract cause, this isn't really the place for it.

</span></p><p style="margin-left: 36pt"><span style="font-size:14pt"><strong><em>A /baphomet/ take on the LOIC seems like the right way to go, in my opinion.<br />If there ever WAS a /baphomet/-endorsed DDoS client, I think it would need to be able to help resolve the common retarded mistakes that occur with planned ddossing; timezones, primary/secondary targets, fallbacks for meetups if everything turns to shit, etc.<br />My suggestion would be thus:<br />The new LOIC would only be able to function if it was connected to a host, ie the raid leader's own little server, who could update the variables (such as countdown timer, specific URLs, the required number of clients attacking each IP address so maximum DoS occurs across a few places, I dunno…) on people's clients (I'm thinking that the client should be alerted if the leader changes a variable, but they'd have to be edited by the user manually. I don't really want to just surrender my PC to a botnet that could be aimed at ANYTHING…) if/when they changed (by working in conjunction with the driving force of the raid in IRC, ie people from /baphomet/).<br />Being able to generate a session should require an additional piece of software to act as a barrier to fucktards, that newfag idiots would be too retarded to find / too shitscared to download if they found it. That would leave the important shit in the hands of people who actually cared about it, while allowing anyone to join the public botnet (but not fire until the countdown timer hit 0 / other parameters were met)<br />This would allow widespread advertisement of the raid and new LOIC to anywhere that would listen, generating a large group of people all under the 'guidance' of /baphomet/, or a proxy group such as 4chan's /b/ for max lulz and 0 blame<br />Sorry if this makes no sense, I'm slightly very drunk. Anyway, I seem to recall Anonymous using something like this a few years back, but I don't know enough about this shit to be able to pass judgement. Regardless, I think the best way for us to actually advance ourselves as social justice warrior warriors is to gain the (unknowing) support of others.<br />Side note, would it be possible to encourage SJWs into ddossing what they thought was 8chan with a program like I suggested, but really have them hit their own shitty sites? We could then post proof to the owners / domain providers for lulz
