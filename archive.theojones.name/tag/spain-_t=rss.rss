<p><a href="http://pus.sagepub.com/content/early/2013/09/04/0963662513500196.abstract">A study published this month </a>in the journal Public Understanding of Science [1. León, Bienvenido, and Mª Carmen Erviti. "Science in pictures: Visual representation of climate change in Spain’s television news." Public Understanding of Science (2013): 0963662513500196.] looked at the relation of visual images to coverage of the global warming issue in Spain's television media.</p>

<p>[caption id="attachment_533" align="alignright" width="300"]<a href="http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/WorldOfChange/decadaltemp.php"></a> This images represents the causes of climate change. Image via NASA Earth Observatory[/caption]</p>

<p>The study found that "<em>the low rate of coverage of CC[Climate Change] can be related to the scarcity of attractive images available to the channels</em>".<!--more--> The authors looked at three issues; the extent to which the lack of images to illustrate global warming, the extent to which images used showcase the impacts of climate change rather than its causes and the extent to which images used represent climate change as a remote process. The research was done through a mix of analysis of television shows aired by Spain's major networks and interviews with journalists. The authors found that climate change is generally considered a niche topic and that scarcity of images is one core reason this is true. Of particular importance is the amount of original images available to networks. Furthermore the visual representation of impacts of climate change looms large in media coverage and can produce spectacular images. Images of climate change impacts are almost always focused on international matters such as the effects of global warming on polar bears. Images of local impacts are rare. The most common way to visually represent the causes of climate change is by showing an image of a smokestack. These representations have a tendency to make the climate change issue seem distant, remote, mundane and insignificant.</p>

<p>I think that the results of this study are related to the current state of climate change denialism. Those who try to ignore the human role in global warming have switched their focus away from arguing that it isn't happening to arguing that it isn't important. Conservative groups in the United States have tried to make it seem like climate change activists are just a bunch of tree huggers trying to save the polar bears at the expense of the economy. Portrayal in the media can bolster this impression when climate change gets portrayed as unimportant.</p>
