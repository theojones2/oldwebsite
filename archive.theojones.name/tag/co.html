<blockquote>
<p>An unarmed man was shot in the head and critically wounded by Los Angeles police officers on Friday night, after he appeared to be flagging them down for assistance.</p>

<p>A passerby recorded graphic video of the incident from a car, and then posted it on Twitter. The video showed officers turning over the man, who appeared to be unconscious and lying on his face, and handcuffing his hands behind his back as his head bled profusely.</p>

<p>The Los Angeles police department said the man, who was not immediately named, had a towel wrapped around his hand and the two officers believed he was concealing a weapon.</p>

<p>Its stuff like that that makes me hate cops. "He is asking me for help. How dare he trifle a cop with such a trivial thing.      <strong>blam</strong> "</p>

<p>The idea of companies that are ran by their employees has been getting some attention in the liberal blogosphere. Often this discussion comes with extreme hype about their promise. Take <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EnoughLibertarianSpam/comments/37cbxv/hey_you_earnest_socialists_has_this_ancap_got_a/">a recent thread on Reddit</a> where the topic came up. There are plenty of people who think that a shift to such a form of organization over the current corporate form will result in a vast improvement in regards to all sorts of political and economic issues. The claimed benefits are wide ranging. Some on that Reddit thread say that eliminate the types of conflicts of interest between business and the public that make regulation necessary, others say there'll be vast environmental benefits, while others happen to believe that a switch to worker owned cooperatives will be the end of unfair treatment by employers and will be a general boon to workplace safety. However, despite the enthusiasm for this idea, it is way oversold. The issue with much of current business occurs when there is no external constraint on the working of business that forces the actions of businesses to follow the interests of the population as a whole. Will cooperatives change this? Probably not. The switch to cooperatives would change the beneficiaries of a company's actions, and the people get to choose the actions of the company, from the shareholders to the employees. However, nothing in economics provides any guarantee that the interests of the average employee of a company will be any more in line with the public purpose then the interests of the average shareholder. Although switch to employee cooperatives would change some issues, namely those that result from insufficient negotiating power on the side of employees, it would introduce new issues and leave many currently existing issues unresolved. The first big category of issues that worker cooperatives have little improvement on over traditional firms is externalities-a coal power plant ran as a cooperative will still have the same economic interests in polluting as a conventionally owned coal plant. The second major issue that cooperatives will be unable to resolve is a situation of economic rents-situations where due to monopoly or scarce resources a firm is able to get revenue that is far in excess of the actual cost of bringing a good into production. A worker owned firm will still want to collect the benefits of these economic rents, and disperse the profit to its members. There is also one major category where such cooperatives would be expected to perform worse than traditional firms, situations where increasing the average per employee revenue of a company is in conflict with increasing its overall productivity. A cooperative will not want to expand into potentially beneficial operations that produce less per worker the current business because there is a risk that such a thing will tend to force the share of the profits given to the incumbent members downward. A better alternative to worker owned cooperatives might be much more egalitarian ownership of conventional firms.</p>

<p>Milton Friedman discussing the possibility of a basic income/negative income tax in 1968. Don't you wish conservatives were still like this instead of like Rush Limbaugh? Probably, part of the reason why Friedman supported this is because, adopting a basic income will allow government policy that is in most other aspects much more libertarian.<br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtpgkX588nM">https:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>www.youtube.com/<wbr></wbr>watch?v=xtpgkX588nM</a></p>

<p>I've been having an issue with a<a href="../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Capture.png.html"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1818" src="../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Capture-300x261.png.html" alt="Capture" width="300" height="261"></a> temporary freeze of my Windows 8.1 computer followed shortly by very high disk read-write activity. I took a while, but I pinned the issue down to swapping. In short, the memory management on Windows is terrible compared to that of Linux. And a Windows computer (or at least mine) will start swapping if you look at it the wrong way -- even if there are gigabytes of RAM left. The only way to fix this is to eliminate the swap file. This should be only done if there is a lot of ram on the system in question -- because if RAM runs out while swapping is off programs are going to crash.</p>

<p>To turn off swapping do the following: <br /> 1. Go to the Control Panel.  Find All control panel items &gt; System<br /> 2. Click on "Advanced system settings"<br /> 3. Under performance, click on "settings"<br /> 4. Go to the "Advanced" tab<br /> 5. Under Virtual memory, click on Change<br /> 6. Disable the "Automatically manage paging file size for all drives" check box<br /> 7. Zero it out.</p>

Its one defining  feature is its friendliness to trolls, and its extremely lax , anything goes moderation policy. Among the more notable members of this community are a large part of the active members of <a href="GamerGate.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#GamerGate</a>, focused around the /<a href="http://8ch.net/gamergate/index.html">gamergate</a>/ board. However, there is a much more nefarious board, /<a href="http://8ch.net/baphomet/index.html">baphomet</a>/. That board has the purpose of a clearing house for doxing, harassment, trolling, and hacking. Its members care little for trivial things like ethics. The rules for the board note that "If you have remorse for you're  [sic] actions you are not welcome ….We never show mercy during raids " and  "so if you're a attention whoring faggot this is not the place for you".  /Baphomet/ was founded by trolls and script kiddies saddened by the switch of focus of the hacking group Anonymous towards activism and away from nefarious destruction. Many members of the /gamergate/ chan are also /Baphomet/ users.  There is a close relationship between the two boards. /gamergate/ is the clean board that provides a respectiable public image for GG. /Baphomet/ has become the home for GG dirty tricks. Want to know what GG is really like? Lets  look into /baphomet/ a bit more <a href="http://8ch.net/baphomet/index.html"></a><a href="http://8ch.net/baphomet/index.html">http:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>8ch.net/<wbr></wbr>baphomet/<wbr></wbr>index.html</a> Note that /baphomet/ is just behind /gamergate/ on the top 25 list of 8chan fora.

I don't really want to just surrender my PC to a botnet that could be aimed at ANYTHING…) if/when they changed (by working in conjunction with the driving force of the raid in IRC, ie people from /baphomet/).<br />Being able to generate a session should require an additional piece of software to act as a barrier to fucktards, that newfag idiots would be too retarded to find / too shitscared to download if they found it. That would leave the important shit in the hands of people who actually cared about it, while allowing anyone to join the public botnet (but not fire until the countdown timer hit 0 / other parameters were met)<br />This would allow widespread advertisement of the raid and new LOIC to anywhere that would listen, generating a large group of people all under the 'guidance' of /baphomet/, or a proxy group such as 4chan's /b/ for max lulz and 0 blame<br />Sorry if this makes no sense, I'm slightly very drunk. Anyway, I seem to recall Anonymous using something like this a few years back, but I don't know enough about this shit to be able to pass judgement. Regardless, I think the best way for us to actually advance ourselves as social justice warrior warriors is to gain the (unknowing) support of others.<br />Side note, would it be possible to encourage SJWs into ddossing what they thought was 8chan with a program like I suggested, but really have them hit their own shitty sites? We could then post proof to the owners / domain providers for lulz

<p><span style="font-size:12pt">The trolling done by members of websites like 4chan and 8chan has been branching out into more mainstream websites. Among the targets of this trolling are many political websites, particularly many in the feminist community. However, as trolling gets farther from the tech <img align="right" src="../wp-content/uploads/2015/01/011715_0817_DontTakeTro12.jpg.html" alt="">community, which is one of the few Internet communities that really understands trolling and how to properly respond to it, you can see many communities respond very poorly to trolling. On many political communities, one particularly common mistake is to take trolls as somehow representing an honestly presented viewpoint. However, this is a gross misunderstanding of what trolls are. Trolls are simply there to stir up trouble in the get as strong a response as possible their target community. Trolls are not honest brokers of opinion in a community. They are in it to upset people for the lulz. The 4Chan community is targeted many feminist blogs and other feminist communities for trolling. The response in many publications has been to assume that the 4Chan trolls are simply presenting an antifeminist viewpoint in a particularly obnoxious way. However, this is not true. The trolls have simply discovered that elements in the feminist community make a good target for trolling that gets them a desired response. The same trolls of fit a wide variety of targets. Here are some of the targets that were hit by 4chan trolls roughly at the same time as the feminist blogs:<br /></span></p>
<ol><li><span style="font-size:12pt">The <a href="gamergate.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#gamergate</a> trolling - 4chan and eight Chan trolls really created the whole <a href="gamergate.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#gamergate</a> thing. I guess you could say this is trolling targeted at the feminist community. But it's not just targeted that community, it's also targeted the tech and gaming community as a whole.
</span></li><li><span style="font-size:12pt">Trolling targeting various conservative and right-wing groups.
</span></li><li><span style="font-size:12pt">The Ebola Chan trolling. 4chan trolls circulated myths about Ebola being spread by Western doctors on forms frequented by many people in the affected countries. This trolling of course, is not because they hate the populations in these countries. Instead, the 4chan trolls know a prank like this will get tons of media coverage and bring in the lulz.
</span></li><li><span style="font-size:12pt">The Apple Wave trolling. 4chan trolls circulated the rumor that claim that owners of iPhones can charge your device by placing it in a microwave.
</span></li><li><span style="font-size:12pt">The <a href="cutforbieber.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#cutforbieber</a> trolling.
</span></li><li><span style="font-size:12pt">And finally, the wide range of swattings and mundane harassment done by the trolls.
</span></li></ol>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt">The one thing that unifies all this stuff is lulz. Lulz is the primary goal of an Internet troll. It is the humor value the troll obtains from causing trouble for someone else. Trolls simply want to see the world burn. The people not familiar with the Internet trolling culture the idea of people who seek destruction and disruption might be a bit hard to understand. But it is what motivates your common Internet troll. If you at all look at sites like 4chan and 8chan , and various other troll hideouts you'll be amazed at the level of effort trolls put in the causing people trouble. Is a passion that motivates and most every day of these guys' lives. They spend months in nursing some of the sock puppet accounts they use in their trolling. A plan intricately detailed operations against the websites they are targeting. But what trolls are not our political ideologues. Sure, trolls are pretty good at pointing out the weaknesses of the communities they are targeting, and they know about limits to the political ideologies advocated by these communities. And they are even better at weapon these weaknesses against the communities. However, they do not particularly care about the outcome of these disputes. It's just another source of lulz for them. And that right there is what many people do not get about trolls.</span></p>

<p>This post is a consequence of the fact that I've seen an recent uptick in gamergate related stuff in my twitter feed and elsewhere. It is pretty difficult to define what Gamergate is, and as far as I can tell GGers are more closely defined by what they are against than what they are for. The best reasonably neutrally stated sense of what GG is that I can make is that it a coalition of various groups in opposition to encroachment of feminist activists into the gaming community. Furthermore, the movement was formed as a byproduct of conflicts between internet trolls and internet feminist communities. Well before GG started, trolls from 4chan, 8chan and other trolling groups and communities, realized that the feminist community makes a trolling target which produces a good source of lulz. Gamergate, or at least its prelude, was the crown jewel of this trolling campaign. It is not a coincidence that Gamergate formed around many trolling communities; this includes the likes of 4chan, 8chan, Wizardchan, and[caption id="attachment_1380" align="alignright" width="300"]<a href="../wp-content/uploads/2015/01/4906597504_3fae1326d2_o.jpg.html"><img src="../wp-content/uploads/2015/01/4906597504_3fae1326d2_o-300x210.jpg.html" alt="Image via Flickr user Sam Howzit &lt;a href=" https:>https:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>flic.kr/<wbr></wbr>p/<wbr></wbr>8tzAuG</a>" width="300" height="210" class="size-medium wp-image-1380" /&gt; Image via Flickr user Sam Howzit <a href="https://flic.kr/p/8tzAuG%5B/caption%5D">https:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>flic.kr/<wbr></wbr>p/<wbr></wbr>8tzAuG[/<wbr></wbr>caption]</a> <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/josephbernstein/gamergates-headquarters-has-been-destroyed-by-trolls#.ymkD0Mvg3">Niko of Death, one of the leaders of the 8chan gamergate community has recently been exposed as connected</a> to the infamous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_Nigger_Association_of_America">GNAA</a> trolling crew (GNAA stands for Gay Nigger Association of America). But is is not safe to say that all, or even most, GGers are trolls. Gamergate came out of the effort of trolls to focus anger at internet feminists in the most lulz producing way possible. Namely trolls at 4chan and such saw that the events which served as the prelude to GG were the perfect opportunity. They realized that there were a number of types of people in the gaming community opposed to feminists, and that good lulz was to be had by blurring the lines, and by uniting them in an incoherent and almost comical message, along with adding a good dose of harassment and threats to the mix. It is even better trolling because it has caused some in progressive/feminist circles to defend some pretty bad stuff -- the enemy of my enemy is my friend apparently.  However, critics of feminism are not a uniform group and the trolling that gave rise to GG was good trolling because of this heterogeneity. These critics and the GG community for the most part, be binned into a handful of groups 1) outright trolls 2) fanboys of certain games who respond virulently to criticism of their favorite games, 3) a number of true sexists,4)conservative activists who have little actual ties to the gaming world , and finally 5) the sub-group with reasonable points. This post is aimed at the last group, a group that I've seen enough of to think exists to an extent. This is also the subset of GG that I think is worth engaging with to some degree, a and that I think makes a number of good points (I will detail this later in the post). And to them I have one question. Why <a href="GamerGate.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#GamerGate</a>? By associating yourself with a community with so many toxic elements you are destroying the credibility of the reasonable points you make. GG has become so toxic and problematic that anything with even the whif of a Gamergate connection is discredited. One last note, just because I am against GG does not mean that I agree with those facing the fiercest criticism by the GGers, other than to decry the harassment they face.  On this post, I will note that I am open to comments on this article. You can comment here, or tweet at me  @Theo_Jones1  With the comments on this post, I'm going to take a pretty light hand with moderation, due to the nature of the subject.</p>
<h1>The Start of Gamergate</h1>
<p>A time line of the start of gamergate is like this <br />*    The fight between 4chan and  internet feminists serves as a substantial backdrop of the whole gamergate issue.<br />*    Quinn (who is also a critic of video games from a feminist perspective) writes her game on depression. The game gets positive press in some publications.<br />*    It comes out that Quinn cheated on her boyfriend with multiple men due to the fact that the now ex-boyfriend leaked chat logs on to 4chan. Some of the men she had relations with worked at some of the publications that reviewed the Depression Quest game, but none of those people were responsible for any of the reviews.There are allegations that the positive reviews of the game came because of Quinn's sexual activity. This echoed to some extent in the community because in many gaming publications there are concerns about issues like payola and other forms of bias. There is no indication that the people who actually wrote the reviews had any .. um .. personal encounters ... with Quinn, and as far as I can tell there seems to be little basis to these allegations. The whole Quinn thing strikes me as just gossip stuff that has little relation to anything important (other than the trouble created by 4chan). I don't care about the personal life of the people who write the software that I use. I just care if the game is any good.<br />*      4chan and others in the internet trolling community, such as GNAA, think that this would be a good chance to stir up come trouble, considering that Quinn is also a vocal feminist.  The assumption seems to be that a war between elements of the gamer community and femminists over gossip BS would be good lulz. The 4chaners cycle through a few hashtags that have a short life span, such as, <a href="fiveguys.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#fiveguys</a>. Readers of internet forums can now enjoy the flame wars on the subject. <br />*      The <a href="gamergate.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#gamergate</a> hashtag is created by Adam Baldwin (who seems to be mainly interested in this because of his conservative politics rather than a interest in gaming). The trolls then move to this and 4chaners move to seed and promote the <a href="gamergate.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#gamergate</a> hashtag. The <a href="NotYourShield.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#NotYourShield</a> tag is later created by a mix of 4chaners and 8chaners. <a href="NotYourShield.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#NotYourShield</a> is supposed to be for women/minority GGers. The footprint of trolling can be seen in the selection of these tags, which can easily be interpreted as double entandres. One could say that its <a href="NotYourShield.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#NotYourShield</a> instead of <a href="NotAShield.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#NotAShield</a> for a reason. And <a href="Gamergate.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#Gamergate</a> itself implys a scandal in gaming, but doesn't say what caused the scandal.<br />*      The dispute extends to other feminists who write about gaming. Anita Sarkeesian , who creates a video series criticizing the portrayal of women in games, gets the brunt of this. Sarkeesian faces death threats and intense harassment. If you are interested, this Wa Po article <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/08/29/gaming-vlogger-anita-sarkeesian-is-forced-from-home-after-receiving-harrowing-death-threats/"></a><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/08/29/gaming-vlogger-anita-sarkeesian-is-forced-from-home-after-receiving-harrowing-death-threats/">http:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>www.washingtonpost.com/<wbr></wbr>news/<wbr></wbr>morning-mix/<wbr></wbr>wp/<wbr></wbr>2014/<wbr></wbr>08/<wbr></wbr>29/<wbr></wbr>gaming-vlogger-anita-sarkeesian-is-forced-from-home-after-receiving-harrowing-death-threats/<wbr></wbr></a> has one of her videos. I think there is a lot to criticize about her work (there is strong sexism in gaming, and a lack of serious female characters in games but she overplays here and on this to an extent), but nothing excuses the level of harassment she has received.<br />*     The movement grows to become a general reaction to feminists and other forms of what the GGers affectionately call "social justice warriors". <br />*      None of the above should be interpreted as an endorsement of either Sarkeesian or Quinn. On this issue it is dangerous to assume that the enemy of your enemy is your friend. Quinn seems to be an asshole with some fringe political views. Sarkeesian has made a number of claims and arguments in her videos that are problematic, or just outright wrong, and has been caught plagiarizing footage and screenshots from reviews of the games she criticizes. Both are active in the quite toxic internet feminist community that regularly uses many of the tactics rightfully criticized when used by GGers.</p>
<h1>The Toxic Elements of GG</h1><h2>The Trolls</h2>
<p>I think these guys have been discussed quite a bit already. These are the 4chaners, the 8chaners, the wizardchaners, the GNAAers.</p>
<h2>The Ideologues</h2>
<p>Gamergate quickly attracted a lot of ideological conservatives that have little interest in gaming or any of the controversy surrounding it. There is a reason why conservative rags like Brebiart, and Daily Caller have been the only mainstream publications to take a pro-GG side. This people dislike progressives and feminists and are willing to take the side of anyone who also does.</p>
<h2>The Fanboys</h2>
<p>A large number of GGers seem to be there because their favorite games were insulted. This seems to be the reasoning behind such things as the outrage over the Polygon Review of Tropico. Sure it was a stupid review, but there isn't much more you can reasonably say.</p>
<h2>The Sexists</h2>
<p>Within the GG community there seems to be a heavy presence of MRAs and other forms of sexists. This is hugely problematic.</p>
<h1>Who Are the Reasonable GGers and What Do They Say</h1>
<p>Are you one of the people that I mean when I talk of reasonable GGers? Here are some questions that will help you decide<br />*  Do you oppose the harassment and toxic behavior of some elements in your community?<br />*  Do you oppose the use of boycotts as a tool of censorship even when your side is doing it (the attempts to get advertisers to pull the plug on anti-GG publications)?<br />*  Do you accept that there are some issues with sexism in the gaming community?<br />*  When you speak of "gaming journalism bias", do you have something in mind more than some idiot writing a dumb review of a game you like?<br />*  What is your reason for being a GGer?<br />*  When you speak of opposing censorship, does that include ideas you don't like?</p>

<p>The subset of reasonable people in GG are the ones that I think make some good points. For these people the problem seems to be some of the authoritarian tendencies of the feminist/identity politics left.  Rather than mangle their words, I will quote one of the better things I've seen written by GGers. Note that there is not total agreement here, but these are the points of view worth dealing with to some extent.  This article <a href="http://www.gamepolitics.com/2014/12/30/gamergate-political-attitudes-part-two-old-liberals-vs-new-progressives#.VKSSBM3OphE"></a><a href="http://www.gamepolitics.com/2014/12/30/gamergate-political-attitudes-part-two-old-liberals-vs-new-progressives#.VKSSBM3OphE">http:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>www.gamepolitics.com/<wbr></wbr>2014/<wbr></wbr>12/<wbr></wbr>30/<wbr></wbr>gamergate-political-attitudes-part-two-old-liberals-vs-new-progressives#.VKSSBM3OphE</a>   attempts to summarize the politics of gamergate. It goes a bit far in trying to find reasonableness where there is none (i.e with MRAs and such in the GG world). However, the end of that article is worth a read.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Political historians have often remarked that the right won the big economic arguments of the 20th century, while the left won the social and cultural ones. Neo-liberalism rolled back economic socialism in the 1980s, and the cultural left beat the moral majority in the 1990s.<br />...<br />Where once social and cultural issues were a source of unity for the left, they now appear to divide it. While many left-leaning GamerGate supporters continue to show strong support for core “cultural left” positions such as abortion and gay marriage, the results also show that they are completely turned off by any of the more recent additions to the progressive agenda – positive discrimination, “call-out culture,” trigger warnings, safe spaces, etc. And, as we saw in my last piece, their level of trust in the left has been severely shaken. </p>

<p>It would be foolish to assume that debates on these issues are limited to gaming. In the past two years, there have been growing signs of quite serious division on the cultural left. It wasn’t just conservatives who were up in arms about Brendan Eich’s firing – liberal publications like The Atlantic and Slate sounded the alarm as well. Alan Dershowitz is no right-winger, nor is columnist Emily Yoffe, yet the former is leading a campaign of Harvard lawyers against the university’s interpretation of Title IX laws, and the latter’s 9-page critique of the same policies went viral. Guardian columnist Nick Cohen is a leading liberal in the UK, and yet an increasing number of his columns are devoted to critiquing what he sees as a growing culture of censorship and “call-outs” [1, 2, 3].</p>

<p>Battle lines are being quietly, warily drawn in the culture wars – not between conservatives and liberals (although conservatives are certainly aware of what’s going on [1, 2, 3, 4] ) – but between liberals and progressives. These two groups, who once appeared indistinguishable, are becoming more so. Liberals are increasingly concerned by what they see as progressives’ embrace of vigilantism. Progressives, by contrast, seem increasingly concerned with the need to change culture by any means possible.</p>
</blockquote><h1>Why The Reasonables Should Disavow GG</h1>
<p>I would agree with a large portion of the previously quote. But people of that nature really should stay clear of <a href="gamergate.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#gamergate</a>. Gamergate has a clear density of outright sexists, trolls, and other types that are bad news. You do not want to give those toxic types a platform. You do not want your reasonable ideas associated with that harassers, and sexists. You want to make it clear that you do not like sexism, while still disputing censorship and authoritarianism. Being part of GG will not help you at all in this. In fact, it will discredit any good idea you have. By promoting a community like gamergate you will score a huge own goal, and will be the biggest help that your opposition could wish for.</p>

<p>Jeremy Rifkin's book <i>The Zero Marginal Cost Society: The Internet of Things, the Collaborative Commons, and the Eclipse of Capitalism</i> has received quite a bit of attention. He has also written some editorials on the Huffington Post, and has been interviews by multiple media sources. However, his core argument borders on the absurd. And perhaps the incredulity that the press has taken showcases a wider problem. Rifkin argues that the transition to products and</p>

<p>services that are dominated by fixed costs will provide a fundamental economic problem. However, the economics behind this view is deeply problematic. The idea that a high dependence on fixed costs provides an insurmountable economic issue is based on the idea that the prices in a competitive market tend towards the marginal cost (the non-fixed cost). This is the result of some simple economic models, but the real pricing behavior of businesses is way different. The problem of how businesses can effectively account for high fixed costs in their pricing is effectively solved. The second major part of Rifkin's argument is that the problems he expects to occur with the wider economy have already happened in the knowledge industries (music, videos, news, ect.). However, he omits a a key difference. Knowledge industries don't just have high fixed costs, they also have a second issue; non-excludeability. Information wants to be free and the copying of media cannot be effectively controlled without producing severe problems. The development of information technology exacerbates this problem because with the internet anyone can become a publisher. However, the physical industries that are tending towards low marginal costs do not have anything like this problem. Therefore, the situation of the knowledge industries cannot be extrapolated further.</p>

<p>It is clear that technology is expanding the role of fixed costs in the economy. Sustainable energy (both nuclear and renewable) tends to be dominated by fixed costs. The cost to run a nuclear power plant at all is about the same as the cost to run it at full capacity. Automation is replacing labor in many industries, and the cost involved with the robots is largely fixed. The services provided by internet service providers are also dominated by fixed costs. Many other examples could be named. Rifkin is perhaps correct to see a trend towards However, the economic problem of how to deal with them in the pricing of products is also not new. While some simple economic models tend to indicate that a competitive market tends towards the marginal cost (which would be insufficient to cover the rising fixed costs), the real world is different. Real businesses price their products based on cost-plus pricing. They take both the fixed and marginal costs, plus the desired profit into account when setting their prices. Real world businesses are capital constrained and will not invest in a sector of the economy if they do not see a net profit. This profit must be on top of both the fixed and marginal costs. Now, how can a business price a product based around a high fixed cost? Simple. There are two options, both of which are in wide use in current markets</p>
<ol><li>The businesses could simply charge a fixed cost to each user, and allow the users to use as much of their share as they want. This is roughly how internet usage is billed. Users pay a monthly fee, and get to use the internet with that access. This method of paying for the fixed costs effectively divides up the fixed cost among each of the users.</li>
    <li>Businesses could charge the average unit cost of the good. Think of a toll road. The costs involved in running a road are effectively fixed up the the point where the road becomes congested. Most toll roads charge a fee for each use of the road. This fee is set on the basis of the average cost per trip (both fixed and marginal cost combined).</li>
</ol>
<p>The problem of pricing low marginal cost goods is effectively dealt with every day by businesses around the world. The rise of fixed costs will not bring down the world. What about Rifkin's comparison to the changes in knowledge industries? Excludeability is the problem there, not high fixed costs. With the internet, it is impossible to prevent someone from copying a work and distributing it. People throughout the world can simultaneously posses a piece of information, and with the internet copying this information is trivial. Copyright, the only widely used way to exclude access to this knowledge is falling apart under this pressure. However, it is perfectly easy to exclude someone from using the power grid, or from using most of the physical services that having growing fixed costs. What happened in the knowledge industries is irrelevant to the wider economy.</p>

<p>it is to a degree amazing that the press did not bring up these issues when covering the book. But the press coverage of technical issues is abismial. The coverage on this subject is no exception.</p>
