<p>In this post I will contend that a good scientific theory is defined by its ability to project what shouldn't happen, not by its ability to predict what should happen. A good theory is definitely not defined by its ability to account for an event. Now, a good theory may be able to do the last two of those things, but that should not be the goal of designing a theory. The least assumptions that the theory contains, the better. A scientific theory is at its core an explanation and description of the world. Its possible to create a bad theory that can account for</p>

<p>any observation. The god did it theory of creationists, for example, can account for any possible observation -- an omnipotent god could do anything. Where it fails catastrophically though is in its ability to rule out possible observations. Evolutionary theory though can tell you what you should not observe under any circumstance. A bad theory can also create correct predictions of the future -- the ancient Egyptian proposal that the sunrise was due the the movements of the gods makes the correct prediction. But it didn't rule anything out in any meaningful way. If the sun rose in the wrong direction one day an ancient Egyptian could have just blamed it on a different pattern of movement among the gods. Modern astronomy is not so flexible. Its easy to project a observed trend into the future. Its much harder to explain the world. Being able to rule things out is a good sign that you have an accurate explanation of the world. When looking at a new theory the first thing you should ask is: what does this say shouldn't happen?</p>

<p>I believe that science is fundamentally a description/explanation of the real world, and that good science is measured by the extent to which the explanation it provides is correct. I believe that the so called <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0704.0646">External Reality Hypothesis</a> is correct, meaning that the objects described and explained by science actually exist separately from their observers. I believe that our current best scientific models are at least partially accurate at describing this reality. Our scientific theories are gradually getting better at explaining this world.</p>

<p>However, it is possible to have two theories that explain the same event. How do you tell which one is correct. I would suggest two rules. Parsimony -- the simplest of the two wins out. And experimental testing -- the one that went through the most rigorous reproducible testing should be preferred. Testing requires that the theories be falsifiable. This means that there must be some reasonable condition that the theory says should not happen. An experiment could then try to produce that condition. If the thing that the possible theory says should not happen happens, then we know that the theory must be wrong.This gets us back to the title of this post:</p>

<p><strong> A Good Scientific Theory Is Defined by What it Says Shouldn't Happen </strong></p>

<p>This concept is at the core of the scientific method.</p>
