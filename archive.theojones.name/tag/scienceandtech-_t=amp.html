<p><a href="http://www.culturalcognition.net/browse-papers/geoengineering-and-the-science-communication-environment-a-c.html">A new study published in <em>Annals of the AAPS</em> suggests</a>that providing information about the possibility of geoengineering might cause individuals to accept climate change. The authors speculate that it has to do with ideology -- conservatives (or hierarchical-individualists as the paper calls them) tend to put a lot of faith in business and industry, and a conventional presentation of the climate change issue tends to be at least somewhat in opposition to business. Geoengennering uses the tools of industry and thus it might be more palatable to conservatives. That line of reasoning makes me wonder if it was a mistake for activists to emphasize renewable energy as the main alternative to fossil fuels. Nuclear might be more favorable for conservatives. The abstract of the paper reads</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We conducted a two-nation study (United States, n = 1500; England, n = 1500) to test a novel theory of science communication. The cultural cognition thesis posits that individuals make extensive reliance on cultural meanings in forming perceptions of risk. The logic of the cultural cognition thesis suggests the potential value of a distinctive two-channel science communication strategy that combines information content (“Channel 1”) with cultural meanings (“Channel 2”) selected to promote open-minded assessment of information across diverse communities. In the study, scientific information content on climate change was held constant while the cultural meaning of that information was experimentally manipulated. Consistent with the study hypotheses, we found that making citizens aware of the potential contribution of geoengineering as a supplement to restriction of CO2 emissions helps to offset cultural polarization over the validity of climate-change science. We also tested the hypothesis, derived from competing models of science communication, that exposure to information on geoengineering would provoke discounting of climate-change risks generally. Contrary to this hypothesis, we found that subjects exposed to information about geoengineering were slightly more concerned about climate change risks than those assigned to a control condition.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.skepticalscience.com/kahan-geoeng-polar.html">SKS' Andy Skuce notes</a> that their framing of geoengineering is pretty slanted. The article presented to participants is the following.</p>

<p><a href="../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/kahangeo1.jpg.html"><amp-img class=" size-full wp-image-2120 alignnone" src="http://www.theojones.name/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/kahangeo1.jpg" alt="kahangeo1" width="545" height="702"></a></p>

<p>The techniques vary a lot, but I generally consider geoengineering better than just bearing the costs of severe climate change and adapting, but worse than actually preventing emissions. The other thing is that the most practical/cheapest geoengineering schemes tend to be the ones with the most adverse impacts. I also think that a geoengineering project will be deployed at some point, as I don't see a full mitigation of CO2 emissions happening anything soon with enough strength to avoid dangerous levels of climate change. The scale of the shift in energy infrastructure is on the scale of the investment that happened to fight world war II, and I see no indication that policy makers are willing to commit to that type of investment quickly enough to change things (even though they should).</p>

<p>I've been having an issue with a<a href="../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Capture.png.html"><amp-img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1818" src="http://www.theojones.name/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Capture-300x261.png" alt="Capture" width="300" height="261"></a> temporary freeze of my Windows 8.1 computer followed shortly by very high disk read-write activity. I took a while, but I pinned the issue down to swapping. In short, the memory management on Windows is terrible compared to that of Linux. And a Windows computer (or at least mine) will start swapping if you look at it the wrong way -- even if there are gigabytes of RAM left. The only way to fix this is to eliminate the swap file. This should be only done if there is a lot of ram on the system in question -- because if RAM runs out while swapping is off programs are going to crash.</p>

<p>To turn off swapping do the following: <br /> 1. Go to the Control Panel.  Find All control panel items &gt; System<br /> 2. Click on "Advanced system settings"<br /> 3. Under performance, click on "settings"<br /> 4. Go to the "Advanced" tab<br /> 5. Under Virtual memory, click on Change<br /> 6. Disable the "Automatically manage paging file size for all drives" check box<br /> 7. Zero it out.</p>

<p>The startup called <a href="https://thegrid.io/">thegrid</a> is releasing a product that is effectively a content management system, roughly similar in functionality to WordPress and such. This startup seems to be promising is software that can handle website design task in a more intelligent way than a traditional template-filling content management system. The company is accepting preorders and has done a pretty intensive advertising campaign on Facebook and other social media and has gotten quite a bit of media attention. They haven't released a beta of it yet, but when they do have something released I'll write a follow-up article saying what I think of it. But just seeing their advertising material on the articles have been written about it I have a few thoughts so far.</p>
<ul><li> This is the type of software that is either going to be absolutely terrible or is going to be very good. I have signed up for the pre order but I wouldn't recommend paying for the preorder unless you are willing to be disappointed. However, it might be worth it you're willing to take a risk, as they do give some discounts for later usage to those who preorder. Having not seen an actual release of this software, I can't recommend it yet. 
</li><li> I seriously doubt that it's going to replace WordPress on this website (unless it has some very impressive features, just on account of the level of commitment I've put into the Wordpress platform already. But it may replace Wordpress as my general go to recommendation for novice computer users wanting to create a website and if it's functional it might be the type of software I use for some new websites.
</li><li>There is a serious market for content management systems are easy to use for not computer types. I think this is the main reason why content silos like Twitter or Facebook or such have become popular over traditional websites. Even with good content management systems like WordPress running a website is pretty tough. If thegrid can improve on this situation they will have a good future.
</li><li>My biggest criticism of what I've seen so far from thegrid that their software, from what it seems, is going to be proprietary and closed source. This is not good. And this has the potential to bring up fundamentally the same issues that occur with the likes of Facebook and Twitter. The upside of their design is that it seems like their software does output static files that can be hosted on other platforms and which are relatively easy to migrate between content management systems. The output format appears to be compatible with Jekyl. But for any platform I use for mission critical stuff, or projects like this blog where I put large amounts of time into it, open source Free Software (in the RMS way) is a must. The fact that thegrid software looks like it will be proprietary severely limits the use cases that I have for it. For a program like this the ability to leave their platform about undue stress is as important as the functionality that their platform provides. I do not want to be trapped in another content silo.
</li><li>Looking at their list of developers; their team seems experienced. It seems like it is within in their skill to deliver on what they are promising. It does not look like this is going to be one of the scams that has plagued crowd sourcing efforts.
</li><li>I really don't like their buzzword filled way of describing their product. They like to use words and phrases like "artificial intelligence" and "websites that design themselves" to really mean "content management system". This makes me substantially skeptical of their product.
</li><li>They have released a few sample websites designed with their engine. These websites seemed generally pretty clean in terms of layout generally have no major design issues. However, layout does seem substantially different in your typical blog or personal website.
</li><li>For this type of thing, the level of customizability is going to be pretty critical. If their engine only has a few possible layouts and designs that can do it's going to be limited to the world of novice users who lack the technical skill in use anything better, or people working on websites so simple they have no use for anything more sophisticated.
</li><li>It seems like they are trying to shake up some of the more fundamental parts of how CMSes function. Their way of handling themes is radically different than the typical implementation. This type of exploration can on
</li><li>A lot of commentators on this, and to some extent developers of thegrid themselves, think that this type of program will replace the role of web designers. I strongly doubt this, they may come up with a way to automate some of the more routine tests that web designers do, but fundamentally creative work still require humans at least to be done with perfection. The best this type of program can hope to do is to leverage the worse is better effect -the fact that her sound the desired functionality can often be delivered by 20% of the effort. This will not be a threat to most web designers, just as the role of cheap and efficient automated translation by services like Google Translate, is not a threat to human translators. This type of software will either be a help to web designers by simplifying some more routine tasks, and/or it will be the type of software used in markets where people can't afford the full effort of a web designer. Web designers and other creative workers will keep their jobs, improved content management systems or not.</li></ul><p><a href="freesoftware.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#freesoftware</a> <a href="googletranslate.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#googletranslate</a> <a href="rms.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#rms</a> <a href="scienceandtech.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#scienceandtech</a></p></div>                    </div>

<p>I'm in the market for an over-the-air TV antenna to go with a TV tuner, and while searching I've noticed more than a few sellers advertising antennas that can get ranges as high as 150 miles.   [caption id="attachment_1440" align="alignright" width="300"]<a href="../wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1802424443_21761d4caa_o.jpg.html"><amp-img src="http://www.theojones.name/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1802424443_21761d4caa_o-300x213.jpg" alt="Image via Flickr user  anomalous4 &lt;a href=" https:>https:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>flic.kr/<wbr></wbr>p/<wbr></wbr>3KgTZv</a>" width="300" height="213" class="size-medium wp-image-1440" /&gt; Image via Flickr user  anomalous4<br /><a href="https://flic.kr/p/3KgTZv%5B/caption%5DSuch">https:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>flic.kr/<wbr></wbr>p/<wbr></wbr>3KgTZv[/<wbr></wbr>caption]Such</a> a thing would be neat as it would allow me reach signals from other cities. But it is too good to be true. Such a device would violate the laws of physics considering the methods used to broadcast TV signals. You will be unlikely to find an antenna that gets more than 60 miles of range, and getting more than 50 miles will come at a high price premium. However, there are lots of people who seem to have fallen for this scam and brought these devices. There are two clear issues that prevent the creation of such a device, at least at a reasonable price. The first is the inverse-square law  of light. Even assuming a flat Earth, a radio signal declines in proportion to square of the distance. Because TV broadcasts are information rich, the antenna needs to catch a lot of information from the broadcast. But the strength of the signal rapidly declines as the broadcast gets farther away. And as there are three dimensions of space that the signal is spreading out in, this change isn't merely linear -- its quadratic.  When the distance doubles the signal (and the cost of picking it up) quadruples. When the distance doubles, the signal reduces nine-fold, when the distance quadruples the signal reduces 16 fold.   There is a second, even more restrictive limit on the creation of a long range antenna -- the fact that the earth is curved. This curvature enforces a line of sight on radio transmissions and therefore sets a maximum range for radio transmissions. Were the broadcasting station merely suspended in space the signal would go out evenly in all directions. However, in the real world, the Earth provides an obstruction. Therefore, the signal is directional, and as the recipient of the signal moves farther away the curvature of the Earth means that he is facing in a direction that is blocked by the Earth. Therefore the recipient is unable to receive the signal past the line of sight.</p>

A victim of the virus shopped there while infected but asymptomatic (and therefore non-contagious).

However, the fact that there was no reasonable threat to the public didn't stop people from avoiding the store because of its Ebola "connection". The sales of the store halved after the re-opening. This store is a victim of a public that does not understand basic science. It is the victim  of irrational paranoia over an extremely rare virus. A basic understand of the facts of medicine would give a typical individual little to fear in such a situation. Only two people have caught the virus in the United States and the clear facts of the biology of the virus show that the infected individual was not contagious. The fact that irrational parinoa destroyed that small business is outrageous.</p>

<p>A few months ago Intel decided to take a pro-Gamergate stance and the company pulled advertisements from anti-Gamergate publications. It was clear to everyone (except perhaps for Intel's marketing department) that siding with a movement with a severe problem of harassment of women in the tech industry and sexism would damage the company's image. And of course, it did.

Through direct builds of my own and advice to friends and relatives, I was involved in a number of computer purchases since this incident. All run AMD CPUs. The Intel backing of Gamergate was a non-trivial part of this decision. Intel now has a problem, a problem that they tried to fix by throwing money at the issue. Today <a href="http://arstechnica.com/business/2015/01/intel-pledges-300-million-to-improve-diversity-in-tech/">Intel announced their intent to donate $300 million to tech diversity initiatives</a>. However, this is not sufficient to relieve Intel of their issue. The fact that Intel would not only back a toxic movement such as GG, but also back one of their most toxic efforts (an attempt to retaliate against journalists who published articles that GG did not like) indicates a severe problem at Intel's culture. A problem that will take much more than money to fix, and until Intel does that, this scandal will be a black mark on the company's record.</p>

<p>the likes of Facebook, and Google. However, I think that this is highly unlikely. First of all, Apple has given advertising a very low priority at the company. And unlike the other companies that Apple is competing with, advertising is a side business for Apple. For the likes of Facebook and Google, Advertising <em>IS</em> the core business. Advertising is the product that brings in the revenue, and the namesake products of FB and Google are just carriers for the advertising payload. Apple on the other hand is a hardware/software firm that has branched into advertising. A company will always be more effective in its core markets, and less effective in secondary markets. I also disagree with the suggestion that China is a location where iAd can get the success it has failed to get in the United States. Advertising is a product that needs attention to the details of the culture being marketed to, and because of this local companies will always have the upper hand.</p>
