<p>An <a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/2785215-apple-iad-is-the-weakest-link?uide=32627285&uprof=10&dr=1">article posted on the investment website Seeking Alpha</a> discusses Apple's forays into the advertising market. Needless to say, Apple has not been successful with iAd (really, thats the name of their advertising division). Their market share is less than 0.2 percent of the global online advertising market. The SA article thinks that Apple has a credible chance of expanding their market reach by imitating</p>

<p>the likes of Facebook, and Google. However, I think that this is highly unlikely. First of all, Apple has given advertising a very low priority at the company. And unlike the other companies that Apple is competing with, advertising is a side business for Apple. For the likes of Facebook and Google, Advertising <em>IS</em> the core business. Advertising is the product that brings in the revenue, and the namesake products of FB and Google are just carriers for the advertising payload. Apple on the other hand is a hardware/software firm that has branched into advertising. A company will always be more effective in its core markets, and less effective in secondary markets. I also disagree with the suggestion that China is a location where iAd can get the success it has failed to get in the United States. Advertising is a product that needs attention to the details of the culture being marketed to, and because of this local companies will always have the upper hand.</p>

      <title>Japan Passes Secrecy Law Poses Risk to Free Speech</title>

<p>Last month <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/07/world/asia/japans-parliament-approves-a-secrecy-law-amid-protests.html">Japan's parliament passed a secrecy law</a> which dramatically increases the range of documents that are kept secret in Japan and increases penalties for leaking documents. The law's definition of what constitutes a secret is vague and the law gives government agencies broad latitude in classifying material. The law's broadness and vagueness, and the harsh -- up to 10 years in prison -- penalties that come with it may be used to harass journalists and whistle-blowers.  <br /><!--more--></p>
<p><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/10/24/us-japan-secrecy-idUSBRE99N1EC20131024">Reuters describes these risk as follows</a>:  </p><blockquote>
<p>Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's government is planning a state secrets act that critics say could curtail public access to information on a wide range of issues, including tensions with China and the Fukushima nuclear crisis.  <br />....<br />"Basically, this bill raises the possibility that the kind of information about which the public should be informed is kept secret eternally," Tadaaki Muto, a lawyer and member of a task force on the bill at the Japan Federation of Bar Associations, told Reuters.</p>
</blockquote><p>It seems like this new legislation will crimp free speech and freedom of information in Japan and it comes in the aftermath of America's NSA scandal, which shows the important role that whistle-blowers can have in journalism.</p><p><a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/china" class="p-category" rel="tag">#china</a> <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/freespeech" class="p-category" rel="tag">#freespeech</a> <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/old" class="p-category" rel="tag">#old</a> <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/old" class="p-category" rel="tag">#old</a> <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/tadaakimuto" class="p-category" rel="tag">#tadaakimuto</a> <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/uncategorized" class="p-category" rel="tag">#uncategorized</a></p></div>]]></description>
