<p>In a previous post I discussed the <a title="The Ludditeism of the Anti-GMO Ideologues" href="https://theojones.name/index.php/ludditeism-anti-gmo-ideologues/">bankruptcy of anti-GMO arguments</a>. Now I will discuss why GMO labeling is a terrible idea.</p>
<ol><li>As I showed in my last post there is no scientific basis to fear GMO products.</li>
    <li>The claimed consumer choice benefits of mandatory labeling can be fulfilled by private certifications and currently existing, government ran certification programs</li>
    <li>Due to the dynamics of food markets, mandatory GMO labeling amounts to a defacto GMO ban. This will increase food prices and possibly add to the environmental damage cause by agriculture.</li>
</ol>
<p><!--more-->If you haven't read my previous post on GMOs, let me recap what I said about the health effects of these products.</p>

<p>The claims made by the campaigners against genetically modified foods are simply absurd. This ideology’s claims about the health effects of GMOs are as discredited in the scientific community as creationism or global warming denialism and all major scientific associations of reputethat have looked into the issue disavow it.  Their position that a compound can suddenly become toxic when synthesized due to a genetic modification of a plant, but is not toxic when synthesized by a natural process violates the laws of physics, chemistry and biology. Their understanding of the economics of these products is not much better. These compounds have passed the approval of the FDA and the EPA. Your food is not being poisoned by <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">the Illuminati</span> Monsanto. The <a href="http://www.who.int/foodsafety/publications/biotech/20questions/en/">World Health Organization notes</a>, "GM foods currently available on the international market have passed risk assessments and are not likely to present risks for human health". <a href="http://www.aaas.org/news/aaas-board-directors-legally-mandating-gm-food-labels-could-%E2%80%9Cmislead-and-falsely-alarm">The American Association for the Advancement of Science concluded that</a> "Several current efforts to require labeling of GM foods are not being driven by any credible scientific evidence that these foods are dangerous" and that "GM crops are the most extensively tested crops ever". Their report also noted that labeling could “mislead and falsely alarm consumers”.</p>

<p>All of the claimed consumer choice benefits of GMO labeling can be done by voluntary certification. All products currently sold as organic in the U.S lack GMO products. Private certifications are also very good at assuring that products are prepared in accordance to standards that are sufficient for their consumers. Note that there are many private companies which certify kosher products.</p>

<p>Economies of scale in food production make it inefficient and cost prohibitive for companies to create separate product lines with GMO and non-GMO foods. Therefore, just one of these options will be taken.If the labeling causes a substantial minority of the population to avoid GMO foods then these foods will be forced off the market for everyone. This has already happened in Europe, where GMO labeling is mandatory. In fact, the push for labeling by the anti-GMO movement is just a pretext to regulate these products out of existence.This will harm consumers and the environment because GMO products require less land usage than their competitors. The price of this extra land will be passed on to consumers, along with the price of increased crop loss. This increased land usage will also have substantial environmental impacts. However, there will be no clear economic benefits to this defacto ban on GMO foods.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Think that Ebenezer Scrooge is a paragon of greed? Well there are many libertarians that would tell you that Scrooge represents the real spirit of the holiday season. Let's start with the Von Mises Instute's <a href="http://archive.mises.org/4460/scrooge-defended/">often reposted</a> classic "<a href="http://mises.org/daily/110">Scrooge Defended</a>". Apparently "his business benefits his employees, society, and himself" -- well at least himself. But that's all that matters to a libertarian businessman.  </p><blockquote>
<p>The fact is, if Cratchit's skills were worth more to anyone than the fifteen shillings Scrooge pays him weekly, there would be someone glad to offer it to him. Since no one has, and since Cratchit's profit-maximizing boss is hardly a man to pay for nothing, Cratchit must be worth exactly his present wages.</p>
</blockquote><p>In glorious Libertopia employees are able to know of all possible job openings and are able to effortlessly switch from job to job at no cost. Employers know about the abilities of every possible employee in existence. Also, Libertopia has no unemployment and everyone has capital available in unlimited quanties, so they can start their own businesses. However, the real world does not work that way.  </p><blockquote>
<p>No doubt Cratchit needs—i.e., wants—more, to support his family and care for Tiny Tim.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Food is just a "want" in Libertopia.  <br /><!--more--></p>
<blockquote>
<p>As for that one lump of coal Scrooge allows him, it bears emphasis that Cratchit has not been chained to his chilly desk. If he stays there, he shows by his behavior that he prefers his present wages-plus-comfort package to any other he has found, or supposes himself likely to find.</p>
</blockquote><p>Its ok to be an asshole to others if they have no other options.  </p><blockquote>
<p>More notorious even than his miserly ways are Scrooge's cynical words. "Are there no prisons," he jibes when solicited for charity, "and the Union workhouses?"Terrible, right? Lacking in compassion? Not necessarily. As Scrooge observes, he supports those institutions with his taxes. Already forced to help those who can't or won't help themselves, it is not unreasonable for him to balk at volunteering additional funds for their extra comfort.</p>
</blockquote><p>Nothing says "extra comfort" like a prison or a workhouse.  </p><blockquote>
<p>Dickens doesn't mention Scrooge's satisfied customers, but there must have been plenty of them for Scrooge to have gotten so rich.</p>
</blockquote><p>We all know that the only way that bankers can get rich is by having lots of satisfied customers.  </p><blockquote>
<p>Scrooge is said to hound debtors so relentlessly that—as the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Be is able to show him—an indebted couple rejoices at his demise.</p>
</blockquote><p>Sounds like we have ourselves a banker.  </p><blockquote>
<p>This canard is triply absurd. First, a businessman as keen as Scrooge would prefer to delay payment to protect his investment rather than take possession of possibly useless collateral.</p>
</blockquote><p>Looks like this libertarian has not done very much business with banks lately.</p><p>Next lets look at the Forbes article "<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/fredsmith/2013/07/17/charles-dickens-ebenezer-scrooge-was-the-ultimate-job-creator/">Charles Dickens' Ebenezer Scrooge Was The Ultimate Job Creator</a>".  </p><blockquote>
<p>The Scrooges of the world were the stewards of the scarce capital—the seed corn prosperity—of that earlier Industrial Age. Ensuring that it was used wisely and honestly was critical to the wealthier England in which Dickens lived.</p>
</blockquote><p>I don't recall reading about how Scrooge invested his wealth on useful investments. I do remember reading about some one who hoarded wealth and gold. Remember that ones spending is someone else's income. Money saved is not money earned.  </p><blockquote>
<p>Every so often, a talented and enterprising individual would launch a new business.....But in this closely knit community, success placed cultural demands on the entrepreneur. He would be expected to make place in his business for an out-of-luck Uncle Bill or Aunt Sally.</p>

<p>Often, that entrepreneur would give into such cultural pressures and add these individuals to his payroll and the operation’s efficiency would decline, often leading to its collapse.</p>
</blockquote><p>Hear that? If a business does not treat its employees and customers like dirt it will shut down. Not being an asshole is like graft.</p><p><a href="ebenezerscrooge.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#ebenezerscrooge</a> <a href="industrialage.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#industrialage</a> <a href="old.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#old</a> <a href="old.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#old</a> <a href="tinytim.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#tinytim</a> <a href="uncategorized.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#uncategorized</a> <a href="vonmisesinstute.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#vonmisesinstute</a></p></div>                    </div>

While Monsanto and its ilk are filled with greedy SOBs, the same can be said of major players of almost every industry in the world. In my opinion this "movement" is just dressed-up ludditeism -- both in the modern sense of general technophobia, and in the sense of the historical Luddite movement's belief that the abuses of sweatshops were an inevitable outcome of the automation of textile production.</p>

<p>Technophobia is a core undercurrent of the anti-GMO ideology. When you read their discussions about "frankenfoods" (of course ignoring the fact that almost all domesticated plants and animals differ greatly from their wild relatives) they are employing the idea that new technology is inherently bad and dangerous, while the "natural" is inherently good and safe. Nothing of the kind is true. Technology has a great ability to improve our standard of living and there are many things that "natural"   Of course there are also harmful synthetic products.I put the word "natural" in quotes because man-made things and "natural" products are created by the same laws of physics. In reality, everything in this universe is natural. To the anti-GMO activist, "natural" just means created with recently invented technology and this technology is scary.</p>

<p>Like the historical Luddites who blamed technology for the ills of the textile industry, when these issues were really created by unethical business practices, anti-GMO activists claim that the bad behavior of business is the unavoidable result of technology. These activists (rightly) criticize the patent litigation of Monsanto. However, instead of seeing this as another symptom of a broken patent system, they inexplicably blame the technology. These activists (rightly) see a greedy monopolist  in Monsanto but they blame the technology instead of calling for anti-trust reform. This attitude will only serve to hold back the progress made possible by technology, without dealing with the systemic issues that allowed these unethical business practices. Rest assured that even without GMO foods, these economic issues will continue to wreak havoc in other sectors of the economy.</p>

<p>Is "hurk.. hurk.. small boobs" really the best criticism of a politician with decades of experience at the highest levels of government the Tea Party and the Republicans can come up with? If they don't their next Presidential primary to become another clown car they should hope not. This type of garbage drives out every person with reasonable criticisms of Clinton's policy proposals and serves to paint the entire GOP as a bunch of cavemen, thereby becoming the best Clinton advertisement money can buy.</p>

<p><a title="Pre-funding Energy Consumption: A Proposal to Encourage Energy Efficiency of Consumer Products" href="https://theojones.name/index.php/pre-funding-energy-consumption-proposal-encourage-energy-efficiency-consumer-products/">A while ago I introduced a way that governments could encourage increased energy efficiency</a>. In this followup post I will discuss why energy efficiency is important. Improvements to America's energy efficiency is one of the quickest ways that pollution can be reduced. This change can also save vast amounts of money. <a href="http://www.worldwatch.org/node/6212">One report on energy efficiency</a> showed that a one time investment of 520 billion dollars in energy efficiency could reduce energy usage by about 25%</p>

<p>[caption id="attachment_738" align="alignright" width="300"]<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Compact_fluorescent_straight_crop.jpg"></a> Image Via Wikipedia and Dedicated to the Public Domain[/caption]</p>

<p>and save over one trillion dollars.One trillion dollars is about $3200 per every American and is equal to about 28 percent of the annual Federal budget. This energy efficiency investment would also reduce CO2 pollution by 1.1 billion tons of carbon dioxide per year. Other sources substantiate that there is a vast potential to improve America's energy use by efficiency.<br /><!--more--><br />Industry is one major sector of the economy where vast energy efficiency improvements are possible.<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544201000172">A 2001 paper</a> [1. Worrell, Ernst, Lynn Price, and Nathan Martin. "Energy efficiency and carbon dioxide emissions reduction opportunities in the US iron and steel sector." Energy 26.5 (2001): 513-536.] showed that with current technology the energy efficiency of the American steel industry could be increased by 18 percent. This would result in a 19% reduction of that industry's emissions. It was estimated that these improvements would pay for themselves within three years. Similarly, <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544200000426">a 2000 paper</a> [2. Worrell, Ernst, Nathan Martin, and Lynn Price. "Potentials for energy efficiency improvement in the US cement industry." Energy 25.12 (2000): 1189-1214.] found that an 11% reduction in the energy useage of the cement industry was possible and that this shift would reduce the emissions of American cement production by 5 percent. <a href="http://escholarship.org/uc/item/31b2f7bd#page-3">A separate 2000 study</a> [3. Martin, Nathan, et al. "Opportunities to improve energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the US pulp and paper industry." (2000).] found that energy usage in the paper industry could be reduced by almost 37 percent. The paper industry accounts for 12 percent of industrial energy usage in America. This data shows that if all of the possible industrial energy efficiency improvements were made, then pollution could be greatly reduced and billions of dollars could be saved. <br />There are also massive ways that households could save energy. A 2009 study found that it is possible for American households to reduce their contributions to CO2 emissions by 20% [4. Dietz, Thomas, et al. "Household actions can provide a behavioral wedge to rapidly reduce US carbon emissions." Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 106.44 (2009): 18452-18456.].<a href="http://www.nohairshirts.com/chap17.php"> A calculation in a 2008 book</a> found that home heating, lighting and water energy usage could be reduced by 80% for newly constructed houses. Already constructed buildings can drive smaller but still substantial energy savings. The cash value of these savings is almost 3000 dollars per household per year.</p>

<p>I just discovered this quote from libertarian commentator Lew Rockwell's website in an article by Walter E. Block.Keep in mind</p>

<p>[caption id="attachment_708" align="alignright" width="267"] Image via Wikipedia and Dedicated to the Public Domain[/caption]</p>

<p>that Block is actually trying to argue for libertarianism but ends up presenting a reductio ad absurdum of the philosophy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/2003/02/walter-e-block/turning-their-coats-for-the-state/">First, you are standing on the balcony of a 25th story high-rise apartment when, much to your dismay, you lose your footing and fall out. Happily, in your downward descent, you manage to grab onto a flagpole protruding from the 15th floor of the balcony of another apartment, 10 floors below. Unhappily, the owner of this apartment comes out to her balcony, states that you are [trespassing] by holding on to her flag pole, and demands that you let go (e.g., drop another 15 floors to your death)… the only proper questions which can be addressed in [the libertarian] philosophy are of the sort, if the flagpole hanger attempts to come in to the apartment, and the occupant shoots him for trespassing, Would the forces of law and order punish the home owner?… When put in this way, the answer is clear. The owner is in the right, and the trespasser in the wrong</a>.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This quote proves two things about libertarianism</p>
<ol><li>The ideology has very little to do with actually preserving liberty, but instead tries to redefine liberty as the right to back up business and property by force</li>
    <li>Libertarianism is more a theory of legitimizing power then a theory of freedom.</li>
</ol>
<p><!--more-->That quote and the rest of Block's writing show libertarianism is about preserving property and business at all costs rather than what any normal person would call liberty. By any reasonable definition of liberty shooting someone definitely results in a strong reduction of their liberty and such an action should only be justified under very extreme circumstances. The shooting in Block's thought experiment was certainly not proportionate. However, property takes absolute priority in libertarian ideology.As Block put it "<em>libertarianism is a theory concerned with the justified use of aggression, or violence, <strong>based on property rights</strong>, not morality</em>" (emphisis added). The corollary of this analysis is that libertarianism is about legitimizing power, not freedom. The libertarian ideology would give individuals and groups absolute power over an area, regardless of the effects on others. By my definition people are free to the extend that they have the largest possible range of capabilities that are not subject to be limited by arbitrary power by others. The libertarian ideology would concentrate power and this power would give others the ability in interfere in the lives of others without substantive check. The government is not the only powerful entity on earth and given the right circumstances private actors can wield great power. But according to a libertarian this power inequality is AOK as long as the property rights check out.</p>

<p>It is fashionable to believe that all laws and government regulations are a restriction on liberty.In-fact, the opposite is true, a society without any law is one that lacks liberty. A well structured system of laws when administered and drafted by a government that is accountable to the public can greatly expand freedom by expanding the range of actions that a typical person can do without being subject to the risk of arbitrary interference. To see why think about traffic laws. If these laws did not exist then the road would be useless to everyone. In a world without traffic regulations one could just blaze down the road at 100MPH, thereby impacting everyone else who uses the road. The range of actions the other road uses can take is reduced. Freedom is limited in this situation because the lack of regulation allows one to conduct dangerous actions that affect all other users of the road. The bad driver has the power to arbitrarily interfere with others. By passing laws these harms can be restricted. These laws expand freedom because allowing increased usage of the road expands the range of actions that the typical person can take without being subject to the risk of interference from another.  <br /><!--more--></p>
<p>Additionally,imagine a society with no government and no laws.In this world a wealthy/powerful person could just hire a hit-man to take out an opponent and no one could stop him. He would have almost absolute power over others.This power over potential targets would be almost as absolute as that possessed by a dictator who could have anyone eliminated at will and is fundamentally similar in nature. If fact a large part of the difference between dictators and the leaders of democratic nations comes from the fact that dictators are not bound by the law. </p><p>When do laws harm freedom? When the laws are not made and enforced by an authority bound to govern in the interests of the populace by rule of law, democracy and legally enforced human rights. Laws made otherwise can become tools to govern, not liberate the populace. But when these conditions are met government regulation expand liberty, instead of reducing it.  </p><p><a href="old.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#old</a> <a href="old.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#old</a> <a href="uncategorized.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#uncategorized</a></p></div>                    </div>

<p>The U.S Census Bureau has published a summary of state and local tax revenues. It appears that they have increased throughout the recession. In my opinion, the positive benefits of stimulus at the federal level have been largely neutralized by austerity at the state level.</p>
