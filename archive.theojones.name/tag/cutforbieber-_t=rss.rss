<p><span style="font-size:12pt">The trolling done by members of websites like 4chan and 8chan has been branching out into more mainstream websites. Among the targets of this trolling are many political websites, particularly many in the feminist community. However, as trolling gets farther from the tech <img align="right" src="http://www.theojones.name/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/011715_0817_DontTakeTro12.jpg" alt="">community, which is one of the few Internet communities that really understands trolling and how to properly respond to it, you can see many communities respond very poorly to trolling. On many political communities, one particularly common mistake is to take trolls as somehow representing an honestly presented viewpoint. However, this is a gross misunderstanding of what trolls are. Trolls are simply there to stir up trouble in the get as strong a response as possible their target community. Trolls are not honest brokers of opinion in a community. They are in it to upset people for the lulz. The 4Chan community is targeted many feminist blogs and other feminist communities for trolling. The response in many publications has been to assume that the 4Chan trolls are simply presenting an antifeminist viewpoint in a particularly obnoxious way. However, this is not true. The trolls have simply discovered that elements in the feminist community make a good target for trolling that gets them a desired response. The same trolls of fit a wide variety of targets. Here are some of the targets that were hit by 4chan trolls roughly at the same time as the feminist blogs:<br /></span></p>
<ol><li><span style="font-size:12pt">The <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/gamergate" class="p-category" rel="tag">#gamergate</a> trolling - 4chan and eight Chan trolls really created the whole <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/gamergate" class="p-category" rel="tag">#gamergate</a> thing. I guess you could say this is trolling targeted at the feminist community. But it's not just targeted that community, it's also targeted the tech and gaming community as a whole.
</span></li><li><span style="font-size:12pt">Trolling targeting various conservative and right-wing groups.
</span></li><li><span style="font-size:12pt">The Ebola Chan trolling. 4chan trolls circulated myths about Ebola being spread by Western doctors on forms frequented by many people in the affected countries. This trolling of course, is not because they hate the populations in these countries. Instead, the 4chan trolls know a prank like this will get tons of media coverage and bring in the lulz.
</span></li><li><span style="font-size:12pt">The Apple Wave trolling. 4chan trolls circulated the rumor that claim that owners of iPhones can charge your device by placing it in a microwave.
</span></li><li><span style="font-size:12pt">The <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/cutforbieber" class="p-category" rel="tag">#cutforbieber</a> trolling.
</span></li><li><span style="font-size:12pt">And finally, the wide range of swattings and mundane harassment done by the trolls.
</span></li></ol>
<p><span style="font-size:12pt">The one thing that unifies all this stuff is lulz. Lulz is the primary goal of an Internet troll. It is the humor value the troll obtains from causing trouble for someone else. Trolls simply want to see the world burn. The people not familiar with the Internet trolling culture the idea of people who seek destruction and disruption might be a bit hard to understand. But it is what motivates your common Internet troll. If you at all look at sites like 4chan and 8chan , and various other troll hideouts you'll be amazed at the level of effort trolls put in the causing people trouble. Is a passion that motivates and most every day of these guys' lives. They spend months in nursing some of the sock puppet accounts they use in their trolling. A plan intricately detailed operations against the websites they are targeting. But what trolls are not our political ideologues. Sure, trolls are pretty good at pointing out the weaknesses of the communities they are targeting, and they know about limits to the political ideologies advocated by these communities. And they are even better at weapon these weaknesses against the communities. However, they do not particularly care about the outcome of these disputes. It's just another source of lulz for them. And that right there is what many people do not get about trolls.</span></p>
