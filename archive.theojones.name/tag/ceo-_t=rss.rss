        <p>This happened: <br /><a href="http://arstechnica.com/business/2014/07/mozilla-confirms-interim-ceo-as-new-top-hire/"></a><a href="http://arstechnica.com/business/2014/07/mozilla-confirms-interim-ceo-as-new-top-hire/">http:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>arstechnica.com/<wbr></wbr>business/<wbr></wbr>2014/<wbr></wbr>07/<wbr></wbr>mozilla-confirms-interim-ceo-as-new-top-hire/<wbr></wbr></a> <br /></p><blockquote>
<p>On Monday, the Mozilla Corporation announced that its last-minute April hire for interim CEO, Chris Beard, has been permanently appointed to the position. Mozilla Executive Chairwoman Mitchell Baker confirmed the news in a blog post, stating that "the board has reviewed many internal and external candidates—and no one we met was a better fit."</p>

<p>Beard's Mozilla tenure began in 2004 and saw him eventually rise to chief innovation and chief marketing officer. He left the company in 2013 to become an "executive in residence" at Greylock Partners, an investment firm with a heavy focus on tech companies. His return to Mozilla in April came on the heels of Brendan Eich's controversial hire to the CEO position, which ended with Eich's resignation that month.</p>
</blockquote><p>Its idiotic to make decisions about the management of a company based on the basis of political stuff that has little to do with the running of the company. Based pretty much on the opinion of people writing flamage on Tumblr, Mozilla replaced one of the founders of the company, a person with wide experience in the firm's core competency -- creating web browsers -- with a marketing type based solely on a donation to a political campaign in 2008. This is utter insanity. I believe that this decision will be a future business school case  study on why it is a good idea to keep personal politics out of the running of a company. The new CEO's current tenure has already shown that he is an inferior candidate. As interim CEO Beard has doubled down on multiple bad decisions by expanding the company's phone project and attempting to enter the computer market by creating a laptop. Beard is attempting to run the company like a regular software company. But the world of open source is different. The open source world already suffers from a high degree of market fragmentation and the actions of the new management of Mozilla will only make matters worse. Beard's decision to add Digital Rights Management systems to the Firefox browser has widely alienated the Linux community. The decision to manafucture a phone puts them in open warfare with many companies with deeper pockets -- particularly Microsoft and Google. It also takes Mozilla far from areas where it has a history of product development. Considering the fact that the Firefox Phone has no user or developer base it has no chance on the market. It is in the same price range as Microsoft's low end phones, and it is also in direct competition with the various Chinese landfill Androids that are on the market. They have simply no serious hope of winning this battle. Their decision to make a Chromebook competitor is similarly boneheaded.  They will be competing with dozens of established computer manufacturers when they have no experience in this area. </p><p><a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/brendaneich" class="p-category" rel="tag">#brendaneich</a> <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/ceo" class="p-category" rel="tag">#ceo</a> <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/digitalrightsmanagement" class="p-category" rel="tag">#digitalrightsmanagement</a> <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/firefoxphone" class="p-category" rel="tag">#firefoxphone</a> <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/old" class="p-category" rel="tag">#old</a> <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/old" class="p-category" rel="tag">#old</a> <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/uncategorized" class="p-category" rel="tag">#uncategorized</a></p></div>]]></description>

      <title>Good Riddance: Microsoft CEO Announces Plans for Retirement Within One Year</title>

<p>Steve Ballmer, the CEO of Microsoft for the past 13 years, <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/heres-microsoft-ceo-ballmers-goodbye-note-to-the-troops-7000019795/">has announced</a> that he will retire within the next 12 months.In<a href="http://www.zdnet.com/heres-microsoft-ceo-ballmers-goodbye-note-to-the-troops-7000019795/"> a letter</a> to Microsoft employees released this morning Ballmer stated that</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>My original thoughts on timing would have had my retirement happen in the middle of our transformation to a devices and services company focused on empowering customers in the activities they value most. We need a CEO who will be here longer term for this new direction. </em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Microsoft is certainly in need of a transition. According to Business Insider, Microsoft stock <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/ballmer-era-stock-price-2013-8">has fallen</a> over 40% during Ballmer's tenure.</p>

<p>Compare Ballmer's stock performance to that during Bill Gates' time as CEO (Ballmer started in 2000).</p>

<p>Microsoft's "transformation to a devices and services company" has consisted of a poorly executed imitation of Apple. This imitation is complete with <a href="http://www.tomsguide.com/us/xbox-one-microsoft-store-display,news-17421.html">Microsoft Stores</a> and a tablet/phone operating system <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-microsoft-ceo-steve-ballmers-failures-20130823,0,2666964.story">no one wants to use</a>.During Ballmer's term Microsoft lost the server market to GNU/Linux based operating systems and failed to put forth a marketable alternative to Android and Apple smartphones and tablets.<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/12/13/windows_market_share_just_20percent/">According to a report released by Goldman Sachs,</a> Microsoft has fallen from almost total dominance of the computer market to just over 20% market share. As the following graph from report makes clear, this change took place almost entirely during Ballmer's tenure.</p>

<p>What about product quality? Well the same tribute comedian David Letterman aired after Bill Gates' retirement could very well be used to describe Microsoft under Ballmer.</p>
