<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I am strongly against the wider deployment of biofuels. There are the obvious interactions between biofuel production and food prices, and biofuel production is largely responsible for the 2007 price crisis. Other than the large-scale humanitarian reasons to oppose biofuel production as a serious alternative energy, there is also the fact that even considering very generous projections, the fuel source is unlikely to ever produce a large amount of the world's energy supply. Compared to the land they take up, plants are just extremely efficient energy producers. This blog post will show how is simply not possible with anything like current technology to meet even a substantial amount of the world's energy needs with biofuels. I will start with a generous estimate of the maximum possible biomass energy production come out of agricultural land. First are some quick assumptions. The first is that world's future energy supply will need to provide a developed nation level of energy use to a population of about 9 billion people. Furthermore, this will at the very least require power production amounting to about 5000 W per person on average. The current US power consumption amounts to about 10,000 W on average. Now let's calculate based on highly favorable assumptions how much of the world's energy supply biomass energy could reasonably provide.<br /></span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Let's first start the total surface area of the Earth, <a href="http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhypertextbook.com%2Ffacts%2F2001%2FDanielChen.shtml&amp;date=2015-05-24">which is about 361,800,000 square kilometers</a>. How much of this is reasonably available to agriculture? Only 150,000,000 square kilometers is land and only some of this land is actually useful for agriculture. So when you adjust you get a total useful percentage of the Earth's land surface area of <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v461/n7263/full/461472a.html">about 15%</a>. Now, that estimate, would result in estimate of global available crop land of substantially less than half a hectare, or about 1 acre of cropland per person. However, that estimate is based on many environmental constraints. Let's ignore them. The purpose of this article let's pretend we want to maximize biofuel production regardless of any environmental constraints, even if it means destroying almost every natural ecosystem around. Let's pave over every roughly arable plot of land. When you subtract out on the uninhabitable land or land is otherwise useless to large-scale agriculture and divide by the future expected population of 9 billion, <a href="http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.zo.utexas.edu%2Fcourses%2FTHOC%2Fland.html&amp;date=2015-05-25">you get an area of about one hectare (~2 acres) of land per person</a>. If all this land were converted to biofuel production, how much energy could it produce? Of course, this will be a highly generous estimate. One hectare is 10,000 square meters. How much energy do biofuel crops produced per square meter? Depends on the crop. <a href="http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.withouthotair.com%2FcD%2Fpage_284.shtml&amp;date=2015-05-25">Corn grown in the United States converted to ethanol produces about 0.02 watts of energy per square meter</a>. When scaled up across the per-person hectare, this amounts to about 200W per person. This is a straight up puny amount of energy production compared to the total world needs. What about improved technology? The previous link suggests that theoretical cellulosic ethanol system could deliver about 0.2 watts per square meter. This gives a somewhat reasonable contribution to overall energy production. However, such a large number as a product of a very generous estimate, and predicts some technology that only exists on paper. And remember, that per person amount is based on an assumption where all reasonably useful land is being devoted voted to the purpose. Already, most reasonably usable agricultural land is already being used for food production. From page 21 of<br /></span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 36pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong><em>About 12 % of the global land surface is currently under crop cultivation (Foley et al., 2005; Ramankutty et al. 2008). The allowed 3 % expansion (approximately 400 Mha) to the level we propose as a land system boundary will most likely be reached over the coming decades,and includes suitable land that is not either currently cultivated or is under forest cover – e.g., abandoned cropland in Europe, North America and the former Soviet Union and some areas of Africa's savannas and South America's cerrado
</em></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Overall, is clear that, at least with current technology biofuels will be extremely unlikely to provide a substantial contribution to the overall substantial energy production. The current programs of subsidies for biofuel production should be immediately phased out. It will be extremely unlikely to contribute to a substantial energy future. In the meantime, biofuel production will compete with food production while producing very little economic value. Because of this competition with food production and because of the tendencies for this competition increase prices and inflation, I furthermore think that even privately funded biofuel production should be outlawed on any commercial, near commercial, or industrial scale. The small scale production that does continue should be heavily regulated, should be forced to use feed stocks that have no risk of competition with food supplies, and should be heavily taxed (due to the imperfections of regulation in catching all unwanted use of the tech). </span></p>

<p><a href="http://www.culturalcognition.net/browse-papers/geoengineering-and-the-science-communication-environment-a-c.html">A new study published in <em>Annals of the AAPS</em> suggests</a>that providing information about the possibility of geoengineering might cause individuals to accept climate change. The authors speculate that it has to do with ideology -- conservatives (or hierarchical-individualists as the paper calls them) tend to put a lot of faith in business and industry, and a conventional presentation of the climate change issue tends to be at least somewhat in opposition to business. Geoengennering uses the tools of industry and thus it might be more palatable to conservatives. That line of reasoning makes me wonder if it was a mistake for activists to emphasize renewable energy as the main alternative to fossil fuels. Nuclear might be more favorable for conservatives. The abstract of the paper reads</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We conducted a two-nation study (United States, n = 1500; England, n = 1500) to test a novel theory of science communication. The cultural cognition thesis posits that individuals make extensive reliance on cultural meanings in forming perceptions of risk. The logic of the cultural cognition thesis suggests the potential value of a distinctive two-channel science communication strategy that combines information content (“Channel 1”) with cultural meanings (“Channel 2”) selected to promote open-minded assessment of information across diverse communities. In the study, scientific information content on climate change was held constant while the cultural meaning of that information was experimentally manipulated. Consistent with the study hypotheses, we found that making citizens aware of the potential contribution of geoengineering as a supplement to restriction of CO2 emissions helps to offset cultural polarization over the validity of climate-change science. We also tested the hypothesis, derived from competing models of science communication, that exposure to information on geoengineering would provoke discounting of climate-change risks generally. Contrary to this hypothesis, we found that subjects exposed to information about geoengineering were slightly more concerned about climate change risks than those assigned to a control condition.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.skepticalscience.com/kahan-geoeng-polar.html">SKS' Andy Skuce notes</a> that their framing of geoengineering is pretty slanted. The article presented to participants is the following.</p>

<p><a href="../wp-content/uploads/2015/03/kahangeo1.jpg.html"><amp-img class=" size-full wp-image-2120 alignnone" src="http://www.theojones.name/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/kahangeo1.jpg" alt="kahangeo1" width="545" height="702"></a></p>

<p>The techniques vary a lot, but I generally consider geoengineering better than just bearing the costs of severe climate change and adapting, but worse than actually preventing emissions. The other thing is that the most practical/cheapest geoengineering schemes tend to be the ones with the most adverse impacts. I also think that a geoengineering project will be deployed at some point, as I don't see a full mitigation of CO2 emissions happening anything soon with enough strength to avoid dangerous levels of climate change. The scale of the shift in energy infrastructure is on the scale of the investment that happened to fight world war II, and I see no indication that policy makers are willing to commit to that type of investment quickly enough to change things (even though they should).</p>

A victim of the virus shopped there while infected but asymptomatic (and therefore non-contagious). [caption id="attachment_1443" align="alignright" width="300"]<a href="../wp-content/uploads/2015/01/2537685236_0eb9a6c92f_o.jpg.html"><amp-img src="http://www.theojones.name/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/2537685236_0eb9a6c92f_o-300x138.jpg" alt="Image via CDC." width="300" height="138" class="size-medium wp-image-1443"></a> Image via CDC.[/caption]The store replaced its inventory and conducted an intensive cleaning and when it reopened after the cleaning it had the support of a number of local officials. However, the fact that there was no reasonable threat to the public didn't stop people from avoiding the store because of its Ebola "connection". The sales of the store halved after the re-opening. This store is a victim of a public that does not understand basic science. It is the victim  of irrational paranoia over an extremely rare virus. A basic understand of the facts of medicine would give a typical individual little to fear in such a situation. Only two people have caught the virus in the United States and the clear facts of the biology of the virus show that the infected individual was not contagious. The fact that irrational parinoa destroyed that small business is outrageous.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/the_dismal_science/2014/07/sweden_school_choice_the_country_s_disastrous_experiment_with_milton_friedman.html">Slate has the following article on Sweeden's school voucher system and its failings</a>.I have a few thoughts on this.</p>

<p>The Slate author seems to be amazed that a generally left-wing country like Sweden could adopt a voucher system.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To the extent that Americans think about Sweden at all, it usually conjures images of gibberish-speaking Muppets, Ikea furniture, and, when it comes to government policies, the welfare state. So it’s something of a surprise that a higher fraction of Swedish students go to privately run (and mostly for-profit) schools than in the U.S.* The system was put in place in the early 1990s by a center-right (by Swedish standards) government,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It doesn't particularly amaze me. Imagine a politician believes all of the following</p>
<ol><li>Milton Friedman was right. A privatized education system built around a voucher system is more efficient than a public system. (For reasons why this argument is doubtful in the realm of education read on)</li>
    <li>Inequality and distributional effects are important.

</ol>
<p>What would such a politician want to do about education in a) a relatively egalitarian country like Sweden with a strong welfare state, and b) a  relatively unequal economy like that of the U.S</p>

<p>In system <em><strong>a)</strong></em> a politician would clearly prefer a voucher system. In economy <em><strong>b)</strong></em> such a politician could defend a government centered education system on the grounds of it being a second best option. A system of taxation increases and transfer payments needed to fight inequality directly might be unrealistic. However, privatizing the education system could disproportionately hurt the poor. Keeping the system public would be a good second best option.<a href="http://www.interfluidity.com/v2/5117.html"> See this link</a> for a discussion of how inequality can provoke second best policies.  This situation can be seen in other policy matters such as the minimum wage (<a href="http://wiki.answers.com/Q/Minimum_wages_per_hour_in_sweden">Sweden does not have one</a> [1. It is worth noting that unions are also stronger in that nation]), or <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/07/opinion/reckonings-a-rent-affair.html">rent controls</a> (Sweden has them, but to a lesser extent than the U.S).  Because of this trend you would expect support for a voucher system to be higher in Sweden</p>

<p>Now, why doesn't the free market argument of Milton Friedman work for education. Well, markets work efficiently when the goals of three groups are aligned.</p>
<ol><li> The person buying the product</li>
    <li>The person using the product</li>
    <li>The public interest</li>
</ol>
<p>Usually the first two are the same individual, but not so with education. The  parents are the ones buying the product, but not the consumer of the education. There are in fact many cases where the goals of the parents can conflict with the goals of the student. In the United States, I have seen a number of charter schools with a business model built around reducing work for the parent as much as possible. And even if there was no conflict of interest between the student's needs and the parent's needs there may be a conflict with the public interest. The student's interest is in maximizing the purely economic interest in the education. The public has a different interest. The public interest comes from providing that people have the skills sufficient to be good voters and citizens. There is no interest in funding vocational training, thereby subsidizing the industries that need the trained workers. Workers/industry should pay the full cost of their economic production. Any economic value that comes from education funding is a good side effect and should not be the target of educational policy (there may be a small second best option-type justification for funding vocational training). I will discuss this further in a later post.</p>

<p>Another day, another lawsuit challenging laws prohibiting gay marriage. <a href="http://www.latinpost.com/articles/16225/20140806/north-dakota-officials-urge-dismissal-lawsuit-challenging-gay-marriage-ban.htm">This time</a> the state of North Dakota is having its law challenged. North Dakota's <span style="color: #000000;">solicitor general has filed a motion disputing the claims in the lawsuit and seeks the lawsuit dismissed. Judging by how other courts have dealt with this issue the solicitor general probably won't get his way. In a post written before the recent lawsuits, <a title="If you love freedom, vote to allow gay marriage" href="https://theojones.name/index.php/if-you-love-freedom-vote-to-allow-gay-marriage/">I argued that gay marriage prohibitions are likely not constitutional, and even if they were should be opposed on policy grounds</a>. In this post I will discus the legal basis for this litigation. The cases are based</span></p>

<p>[caption id="attachment_1351" align="alignright" width="300"]<a href="../wp-content/uploads/2014/08/6685160247_5e2fbc8e78_o.jpg.html"><amp-img class="size-medium wp-image-1351" src="http://www.theojones.name/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/6685160247_5e2fbc8e78_o-300x225.jpg" alt="Image via Flickr user Janet Lindenmuth &lt;a href=" https:>https:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>flic.kr/<wbr></wbr>p/<wbr></wbr>bbKcez</a>" width="300" height="225" /&gt; Image via Flickr user Janet Lindenmuth <a href="https://flic.kr/p/bbKcez%5B/caption%5D">https:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>flic.kr/<wbr></wbr>p/<wbr></wbr>bbKcez[/<wbr></wbr>caption]</a></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">around section 1 of the 14th amendment which reads </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law;<strong> nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Emphasis added. The bolded part is the equal protection clause. The courts interpret this based on three standards of scrutiny.The higher standards are only applied to certain protected classes. For a law that targets a group of people to pass the scrutiny of the courts, the law must meet standards that vary based on the scrutiny test applied.</p>
<ol><li>Strict Scrutiny. This standard is applied to laws that impact a fundamental right (i.e one in the Bill of Rights). More relevant to this case is the fact that this standard is used in regards to some protected classes, particularly race.   To pass this standard the government must have a compelling governmental interest, the legislation must be narrowly tailored to fulfill the interest, and must be the least restrictive means of meeting the interest. This is the most stringent of the standards.</li>
    <li>Intermediate Scrutiny. This is the standard that applies on the basis of sex/gender discrimination, among other protected classes.To pass this standard a law must further important government interest in a way that is substantially related to that interest</li>
    <li>The third standard is the rational basis test. It has two poorly defined sub-types. The cases where each is used have not been well defined.
<ol><li>Regular rational basis -- this is the generic standard that applies to all laws. It is nearly all permissive. A law has to be rationally related to a legitimate government interest. This legitimate government interest does not need to be the actual reason for the law nor do the costs of the legislation have to be proportionate to the interest.</li>
    <li>Rational basis with teeth. This is a poorly defined heightened version of the rational basis test This adds to the regular rational basis standard by declaring that the interest must be strong enough that a reasonable and impartial legislature could come to the conclusion that the legislation is justified. The gay marriage related cases that have involved rational basis have used this standard.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>Now we need to figure out which one of these standards to apply to gay marriage. Unfortunately, the Supreme Court has not stated which of these standards applies to gay rights, nor has it provided clear guidelines for determining which groups are protected by which standards. The selection of a scrutiny standard is to an extent arbitrary. I would argue for intermediate scrutiny on the grounds that discrimination against LGBT groups is analogous to discrimination on the basis of sex. We shall see what the courts will do with this issue. So far, the lower courts and state that have dealt with this issue have picked every one of the possibilities. The selection of the scrutiny standard is critical to the outcome of the lawsuits on gay marriage. A determination of strict scrutiny or intermediate scrutiny will close the case in the favor of gay rights. This is because strict scrutiny pretty much is a complete prohibition of discrimination ,and intermediate scrutiny severely bounds and puts strong limits the range of possible discrimination. It is severely unlikely that the states will be able to find the needed important government interest to meet intermediate scrutiny. A determination of rational basis with teeth will favor gay rights, but will leave a possibility that the state could still snatch a victory, as they will have difficulties showing an actual and substantial harm caused by allowing gay marriage. A finding of normal rational basis will be a clear victory for the states, as normal rational basis is nearly all permissive.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that I think that this whole standards of scrutiny system for the equal protection clause is a Rube Goldberg system. I will leave you with thoughts from Justice Stevens on this from <em><a href="http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/cleburne.html">City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center</a></em> (1985)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am inclined to believe that what has become known as the [tiered] analysis of equal protection claims does not describe a completely logical method of deciding cases, but rather is a method the Court has employed to explain decisions that actually apply a single standard in a reasonably consistent fashion." In my own approach to these cases, I have always asked myself whether I could find a "rational basis" for the classification at issue. The term "rational," of course, includes a requirement that an impartial lawmaker could logically believe that the classification would serve a legitimate public purpose that transcends the harm to the members of the disadvantaged class. Thus, the word "rational" -- for me at least -- includes elements of legitimacy and neutrality that must always characterize the performance of the sovereign's duty to govern impartially.</p>

<p>The rational-basis test, properly understood, adequately explains why a law that deprives a person of the right to vote because his skin has a different pigmentation than that of other voters violates the Equal Protection Clause. It would be utterly irrational to limit the franchise on the basis of height or weight; it is equally invalid to limit it on the basis of skin color. None of these attributes has any bearing at all on the citizen's willingness or ability to exercise that civil right. We do not need to apply a special standard, or to apply "strict scrutiny," or even "heightened scrutiny," to decide such cases.</p>

<p>In every equal protection case, we have to ask certain basic questions. What class is harmed by the legislation, and has it been subjected to a "tradition of disfavor" by our laws? What is the public purpose that is being served by the law? What is the characteristic of the disadvantaged class that justifies the disparate treatment? In most cases the answer to these questions will tell us whether the statute has a "rational basis." The answers will result in the virtually automatic invalidation of racial classifications and in the validation of most economic classifications, but they will provide differing results in cases involving classifications based on alienage, gender, or illegitimacy. But that is not because we apply an "intermediate standard of review" in these cases; rather it is because the characteristics of these groups are sometimes relevant and sometimes irrelevant to a valid public purpose, or, more specifically, to the purpose that the challenged laws purportedly intended to serve</p>

<p>What are the values that have made America and Americans different? An American can be of any race, creed, religion, philosophy, or ethnicity. The United States has never been a country of one religious or ethnic group, and Americans have many diverse political philosophies. The ideal of America has been that of a country where immigrants from throughout the world could come and make a good life and where Americans from all socioeconomic backgrounds could move up the economic ladder, or at the least attain a good education and provide for themselves and their families if they work hard. America has always been a melting pot and a nation of diversity. America is a home for persons of all types­­ there is no one stereotypical real American.</p>

<p>Americans enjoy freedom of speech and religion and live under a legal system that protects these basic individual rights. What makes a real American is the strong belief in these values and the freedoms that come with being a citizen of the United States, as well as respect for those values and freedoms. The United States was founded to be a country where the most famous lines of the Declaration of Independence -- a document ratified 237 years ago today -- ring true, where “<em>We hold these truths to be self­ evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.</em>”</p>
<div title="Page 1">
<p>America was founded to be a nation of laws, not men, where there would never be a European­style aristocracy and where all were equal in rights and opportunity. These values are inherently both communal and individual as both liberty and equality involve the relations between individuals to other individuals in society. Because of this, the power of community has been at the heart of what makes America great. While these values and hopes have never been fully implemented, and there are still great inequities in American society, these values form the heart and soul of America and its people.</p>
<div title="Page 1">
<p>The fact that America is a nation of diversity can be seen in where Americans have come from. There have been Americans that have come from almost all cultural groups in the world.</p>
<div title="Page 2">
<p>Starting even before independence, America has been a melting pot of immigrants of different cultures and religions. British Puritans and Pilgrims migrated to the New World for religious liberty and settled in New England and founded the colonies of Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Connecticut. Quaker immigrants settled Pennsylvania looking for religious freedom. Pennsylvania after Quaker settlement was the first colony to provide religious freedom to all and soon became home to individuals of many religions. The Dutch founded what is now New York City, but this land was eventually absorbed into the British Empire. New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Delaware attracted many Irish, German and Scandinavian immigrants. By 1790 almost one half of the American population was not of British ancestry. Restrictions on immigration and importation of goods imposed by the British were a significant cause of the American Revolution. One of the grievances against the British monarch stated in the Declaration of Independence is that “<em>He has endeavored to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither</em>... “</p>
<div title="Page 2">
<p>After independence, the United States immigration laws were extremely permissive. The Naturalization Act of 1790, which was the first U. S. immigration law, placed no restrictions on immigration and allowed free whites to obtain citizenship after two years of residency in the United States. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, the United States had a free migration policy and had massive flows of immigrants from European nations, such as Ireland, and immigrants from Asia. This migration was its strongest around the time of the Irish Potato Famine. The inscription on the Statue of Liberty greeted the immigrants entering the country through Ellis Island with the following poem written by Emma Lazarus and titled The New Colossus. It summed up America's values toward immigrants,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame, With conquering limbs astride from land to land; Here at our sea­washed, sunset gates shall stand A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name Mother of Exiles. From her beacon­ hand Glows world­ wide welcome; her mild eyes command The air-­bridged harbor that twin cities frame. 'Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!' cries she With silent lips. 'Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest ­tossed to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!'”</p>
</blockquote><div title="Page 3">
<p>America was open to immigrants throughout the world and was a nation of opportunities. It is clear that this history has made the United States a nation of diversity created by immigrants from all over the world. This American history of immigration is what makes being American not about what religious or ethnic group you are part of, but about the American values of liberty and equality that are so eloquently summed up by The New Colossus. American values have always been to create a nation where people from throughout the world could come to experience liberty and opportunity. What makes an American is therefore belief in these values, the values that have attracted and brought so many immigrants to the United States.</p>
<div title="Page 3">
<p>The core values of America that shape and created the nation are liberty and equality. These values have drawn immigrants to the nation since the Puritans, Pilgrims and Quakers first set foot in the New World looking for religious liberty. It is these values that define what being an American is and form the basis of the American community. America was founded to be a place where no king could arbitrarily interfere with basic liberties. Freedom and equality come hand in hand and cannot exist without each other.</p>
<div title="Page 3">
<p>Freedom in the American community means not being dominated over, and living in a community with other citizens that are equal in rights and opportunities. American poet and author Walt Whitman defined freedom as follows, “<em>Freedom --­ to walk free and own no superior.</em>“ and said this of being a citizen of America, “<em>Neither a servant nor a master am I</em>.” These values have motivated American activists throughout the nation's history to fight for what is right and to fight to bring liberty and equal opportunity to all.</p>
<div title="Page 3">
<p>The founders of the United States saw freedom and equality as inherently linked. Excessive inequality could result in aristocracy and would be corrosive to society and freedom. But freedom was inherently linked with accepting that all men are created equal. Alexis de Tocqueville, a famous French author who wrote about the early United States, said, “<em>Grant me thirty years of equal division of inheritances and a free press, and I will provide you with a republic.</em>” In the Federalist #10, James Madison stated that “<em>the most common and durable source of factions has been the various and unequal distribution of property. Those who hold and those who are without property have ever formed distinct interests in society.</em>”</p>
<div title="Page 4">
<p>The struggle for freedom and equality for all has defined the United States throughout its history and defines what it means to be an American. The biggest questions in American history have been “what is liberty?” and “what is the proper relation between liberty and order?” and the biggest struggles in American history have involved expanding freedom and equality. The greatest victories in these struggles have come in four waves. The first wave of this struggle came with the Revolutionary War and the formation of the new United States government. The second wave of the American struggle for freedom for all came with the U.S Civil War and its aftermath. The third wave of this struggle came with the Great Depression, the New Deal and the Second World War and its aftermath. The fourth wave was the Civil Rights Movement. The Declaration of Independence was the statement of the core values of America and its people. However, the realization that “<em>all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights</em>” came throughout the history of the United States and is still not entirely complete. The Declaration of Independence stated that the role of government ought to be to protect these rights and that a just government is based around the consent of the governed. After independence, American society became the closest in existence to a society without an aristocracy. A government was created that was the closest thing to a republic of laws, not men, that existed in the world. About a decade after the end of the revolution, a constitution was ratified that created a new national government for the United States. In its Preamble the Constitution stated its purpose as follows, “<em>to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity.</em>” Shortly thereafter, a second great American document was created, the Bill of Rights. This document protected many fundamental rights from government violation. Through many years of existence and legal interpretation, the Bill of Rights became a great American document that has played a large role in determining the nature of American freedom and liberty and has been at the heart of the shared American historical and cultural heritage. These documents are part of what makes America what it is and Americans who they are.</p>
<div title="Page 5">
<p>The history of the Civil War and reconstruction resulted in a great expansion of liberty, the end of slavery, and the expansion of the rights of citizenship to many Americans who did not receive those liberties before. The legal changes that happened during this period are most dramatically reflected in the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, which reads in part, “<em>No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.</em>” The 14th Amendment's declaration that all are equal before the law put the Declaration of Independence's most famous value into the constitution. It stated that all Americans have rights that must be protected by law. Furthermore, the Civil War and its aftermath helped define what it means to be American by creating an American national identity. Americans were Americans first and foremost instead of residents of their states first and foremost.</p>
<div title="Page 5">
<p>The New Deal era and the aftermath of World War II brought a new era in the expansion of rights in the United States. During the New Deal, it was realized that liberty included certain economic rights and that protecting the liberty of the population included giving everyone economic opportunities. In a tradition that went back to the nation's founding, it was realized that excessive concentrations of wealth were harmful and made it difficult to maintain the conditions needed for freedom to continue. The Second World War and its aftermath saw the exportation of the American values of freedom for all to the rest of the world. During the war, President Franklin D. Roosevelt made his Four Freedoms speech in which he stated that freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom from fear, and freedom from want were human rights that ought to be protected for all persons everywhere in the world. This speech served to be an inspiration for the development of the United Nations after the war, and the expansion of human rights to everyone throughout the world. The civil rights movement that started in the 1950s expanded the horizons of American liberty and freedom. The formal racial segregation and discrimination of the Jim Crow era was ended and economic discrimination was reduced. Courts made important civil rights and civil liberties decisions that expanded liberty and equality for all. Economic programs such Lyndon Johnson's Great Society expanded opportunity and alleviated poverty. During the 1970s and 80s women's rights were established and expanded., in a large part due to court victories won by activists.</p>
<div title="Page 6"><div title="Page 6">America is a nation of diversity created by a history of immigration, a nation not made of any one cultural or religious group. This nation has been a place where people of all kinds came for a better life throughout its entire history. This has been true since even before U.S independence. From Quaker and Puritan immigrants looking for religious freedom, to the immigrants of Ellis Island to modern immigrants, people have come to America looking for freedom. America has been a nation of ideals and laws, not of men or aristocracy, throughout its history. These values of freedom and equality have inspired struggle for all of America's history. While these struggles have never created a perfect union, America has become more perfect and a greater home to the blessings of liberty over its history. What makes a real American is not simply who you are, but it is our shared values and the belief that you have the freedom and opportunity to become all that you want to be, as long as you don't violate the freedoms and liberties of others. It is this belief in liberty and equality for all that makes America great and makes being an American great. The constitution gives Americans certain rights and our freedom and liberty are guaranteed. But what makes an American a real American is the respect for these values and the respect for the struggle that secured these freedoms, as well as a determination to continue to protect and fight for these values.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><p><a href="civilwar.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#civilwar</a> <a href="newdeal.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#newdeal</a> <a href="newyorkcity.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#newyorkcity</a> <a href="old.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#old</a> <a href="old.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#old</a> <a href="uncategorized.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#uncategorized</a> <a href="unitedstates.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#unitedstates</a></p></div>                    </div>

            </p>
            
<p>The Trans-Pacific Partnership is a proposed trade agreement involving multiple countries bordering the Pacific Ocean. These countries include the United States, Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore.  However, this agreement is not just about trade. It contains multiple riders relating to copyright, trademark, patent, and anti-trust law. Some of these riders will also serve to censor journalists and researchers, particulary those who study computer security. I believe that these riders will have effects that are harmful enough to erase the benefits of the increased trade that the treaty may bring. The trade parts of the treaty are good, the riders are not. In this post I will briefly discuss the reasons why I generally support free trade. I will then discuss some of the problematic parts of this agreement.  <br /><!--more--></p>
<h3>My General Opinions On Trade</h3><p>I believe that in general <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/economy/economy-lab/imports-are-a-benefit-exports-are-a-cost-is-it-clear-now/article614908/">imports are a benefit to the economy and exports are not a benefit, but instead the cost of imports</a>. Trade provides the economy tangible goods that can only be produced in the domestic economy at a high cost if at all. I believe that a majority of the trade barriers which remain in the economy primarily "protect" skilled industries.Protectionism harms the economy. It causes consumers to pay more, and because protectionism harms domestic industries that rely on imported materials it can serve as more of a job swap than job protection. An economy in free trade will tend to focus on its most productive industries, and thereby maximize its productivity.</p><p>There are only a handful of cases where I believe that trade restrictions may be justified and none of these cases are protectionist.For example, a government may enact a humanitarian trade restriction, such as a trade sanction designed to deter a human rights violation. Some trade and immigration restrictions may be necessary to give nations policy space to enact needed programs or to protect global economic stability. These may include capital controls designed to restrict speculative transactions that destabilize markets, or possibly some restrictions on immigration designed to limit migrant inflows to a level that an economy has the ability to sustain itself without excessive disruption. Some trade restrictions may also be necessary to develop domestic industry, to allocate limited foreign capital resources in an optimal way, or to phase out a trade policy that cannot be sustained in the long run. Restrictions of this form may be more necessary in developing nations or small nations with limited economic resources.</p><p> </p><h3>The TTP and Free Speech</h3><p>Article 4 of the latest draft of the TTP prohibits the development or publication of technology or methods that serve to "enable or facilitate" the circumvention of a computer security system. This could have a severe chilling effect on discussion and education about computer security. Even though there is a narrow exemption for research this provision could be used to intimidate scholars looking into computer security issues. Even worse would be the effect  on journalists, as there is no exemption for their work. Journalists would be restricted in their ability to discuss computer security issues and would need the approval of the software developer before they could publish information about security  vulnerability in a computer program. J<a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2007/05/09-f9-legal-primer">udicial interpretation of similar</a>, but more narrow, laws already on the books in the United States suggests that the TPP could make it illegal for bloggers or journalists to even link to websites that publish software that can be used to disable copy protection.</p><p>This provision would also restrict the ability of librarians to archive books and other works which are protected by copy protection. The provision of the treaty which applies penalties to anyone who “distributes, imports for distribution, broadcasts, communicates or makes available to the public copies of works [protected by DRM when the DRM has been disabled]” would completely prohibit librarians from making these archives open to the public.</p><p><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/08/new-leaked-tpp-puts-fair-use-risk">The TPP would reduce the fair use restrictions that allow excerpts of copyrighted works to be used for "criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship and research".  </a>  </p><h3 style="text-align: center;">Copyright, Patent, and Trademarks</h3><p><a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/tpp">The treaty would have other effects on copyright law</a>. It would  </p><ol><li>Enhance the liability put on ISPs for the actions of their users, and would make it easier for people who claim a copyright to force ISPs to remove their users' data. This takedown procedure would have little to no independent oversight and would have few protections against false claims.</li>
    <li>It would expand copyright terms  to the life of the author plus 70 years.</li>
    <li>It would <em>prohibit</em> the resale of copyrighted works between countries without the permission of the copyright holder, even when the copies were legally purchased.</li>
</ol><p>The treaty would also expand the scope of patent law by  </p><ol><li>Lowering the standards needed for an invention to receive a patent. The TPP declares that “patents shall be available for any new forms, uses, or methods of <strong>using a known product</strong>; and may satisfy the criteria for patentability, <strong>even if such invention does not result in the enhancement of the known efficacy of the product</strong>.” (emphasis added)</li>
    <li>The treaty also expands the scope of genetic patents. It declares that patents may be granted on “plants and animals”.</li>
    <li>It also expands the scope of medical patents and allows patents on “diagnostic, therapeutic, and <strong>surgical methods</strong> for the treatment of humans or animals.” Emphasis added.</li>
</ol><p>Trademarks are also expanded.“No Party may require, as a condition of registration, <strong>that a sign be visually perceptible</strong>, nor may a Party deny registration of a trademark solely on the grounds that the sign of which it is composed is a sound or a scent.” Emphasis added.</p><p> </p><p>I will discuss the anti-trust and regulatory implications of the treaty in a later post.</p><p><a href="freespeech.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#freespeech</a> <a href="newzealand.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#newzealand</a> <a href="old.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#old</a> <a href="old.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#old</a> <a href="tpp.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#tpp</a> <a href="uncategorized.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#uncategorized</a> <a href="unitedstates.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#unitedstates</a></p></div>                    </div>

<p>As a follow up to <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140326141811/%3Ca%20href=" https:>https:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>theojones.name/<wbr></wbr>index.php/<wbr></wbr>2014/<wbr></wbr>01/<wbr></wbr>05/<wbr></wbr>done-u-s-health-care-system/<wbr></wbr></a>" title="What should be done with the U.S health care system?"&gt;yesterday's blog post, I will discuss why we need a health care system which provides universal coverage. <br />What would you do if one day while you were driving on the highway and you saw a car accident victim lieing on the road injured bleeding to death? Most people would try to help the injured person. Some states even require you to do so. When that person is taken to the hospital the hospital is required to provide treatment regardless of the victim's ability to pay.  However, our current healthcare system is not as compassionate to a cancer patient who can not afford the treatment he needs to live. There are millions of uninsured in this country that might face the same fate as that hypothetical cancer patient. <br />Many of you might be worried about the involvement in the healthcare system by government that guaranteeing healthcare as a human right might entail. While this debate is just about whether healthcare is a human right I will address this issue. Are private insurance companies that are accountable to nothing but their profit margins really any better then an accountable elected government? Under our current system you have life and death decisions being made to maximize profit instead of providing healthcare to all.  </p>

<p><!--more--><br />I will argue that healthcare is a human right. Something can become a human right if it is needed to sustain human freedom and dignity. That is the very definition of a right. Protecting human rights keep society livable for all citizens.   I will argue that in the 21st century healthcare is needed for the the rights of "life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness" that are detailed in the United States Deceleration of Independence  to truly take effect.  <br />Very few of will dispute commonly recognized human rights such as freedom of speech, privacy and the ability to participate in the political system. Why should health care also be in this list? One reason is that it's a right that is necessary to fully utilize the political rights. All the rights that exist on paper mean nothing to a dead person. Having the ability to be alive and healthy is a necessary predecessor to being able to enjoy civil and political rights. <br />  <br />The rationale for healthcare being a human right really all goes back to what's in our Declaration of Independence. The Declaration of Independence guarantees everyone "life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness" In our modern society healthcare is life. No one can easily have equal opportunity in pursuing happiness when they have to worry about how they'll pay for their child's cancer treatment. Human rights are special because of the fact that human rights directly relate to fundamental human needs.</p>

<p> Health care  qualifies as a fundamental human need in the 21st century. If you don't have healthcare you get sick and die. Having a functional body that is not collapsing around you is the first and foremost need of humans. It is the need that we are the most concerned about and it is the need that we seek to fulfill for our selves before we become concerned about such issues as participating in society to make the world a better place.   People without healthcare can not fully participate in the society. The level of poverty that allows people to go without something as fundamental as adequate healthcare undermines human dignity. The suffering of someone who can not get the cancer treatment they need is real and it is an avoidable side effect of our current economic system. <br />Even in a industrialized economy like the U.S many people still die from lack of health care. According to a study by Harvard University that was cited by a 2009 article in Reuters over 45,000 Americans die from lack of health care.the study found that the uninsured aged between 17 an 64 have a 40% higher chance of dyeing then those that have health insurance.  According to the U.S Department of Health and Human Services there are almost 46 million uninsured. There are 46 million people in the wealthiest nation in the world that might die of a preventable cause because we have chosen not to provide healthcare to them. <br />Even children and babies are not immune the the effects of lack of healthcare. According to the United Nations Population Division the United States has a infant mortality rate of 6.3 deaths per 1000 births. Nations with universal healthcare tend to have lower infant mortality rates. For example Norway has a infant mortality rate of 3.3 deaths per 1000 births and Sweden has a infant mortality rate of 3.2 deaths per 1000 births <br />The lack of health care in the United States is an issue that causes millions throughout this country to worry and suffer This problem even causes some people to lose their lives. This is one of the strongest arguments that health care is a human right. In the 21st century with all of the inventions of modern medicine that can extend the average person's life by decades healthcare means life. <br />The role of our government is to provide for the safety and protection of its population and to provide a framework for a system  truly allow everyone to pursue happiness.The preamble to the U.S Constitution gives a good summary of this role of government. It reads </p>
<blockquote>
<p>We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> Healthcare isn't all that distinct from other human rights. All human rights require some degree of legal enforcement to be set up so they can be fully realized by the population. One can not invision a workable system where property rights self enforce but they are still internationality reconised as a right that deserves enforcement. Even the political rights require an independent judiciary to validate that they are indeed being enforced.</p>

<p>The argument that healthcare is a human right is bolstered by such treaties as the universal declaration of human rights , which includes the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and  <br />well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing  <br />and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in  <br />the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other  <br />lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Universal Declaration of Human Rights was written by the United Nations in 1948 and just eight of the U.N member states chose not to approve the treaty.</p>

<p>In the 21st century healthcare is needed for the the rights of "life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness" to truly take effect. In our world with the wonders of modern science and medicine healthcare is life. Thousands in this country die each year because of lack of healthcare. The U.S has an obligation help the right to healthcare be realised at home and abroad. </p>

<p>America should have universal healthcare available to all residents of the country at an affordable price. I believe that the United States healthcare system should be a public insurance system-- one where a government agency is the sole provider of basic health insurance. This basic health coverage should replace Medicare, Medicaid, and the health insurance provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). But some fees should still be charged to patients based on income, ability to pay, and the type of healthcare used. This would prevent overuse of healthcare services. Payments to healthcare providers, such as physicians, should generally be on a fixed salary basis. That is, doctors would be paid a salary, instead of a payment for each appointment or service provided. Additionally, hospital care should be transitioned to a public provider system operated by local governments and funded by the federal government through its insurance system. I also propose a drastic reform of the pharmaceutical industry that includes eliminating patents on drugs and instead funding medical research through government spending, which I will discuss in a follow up post. The role of private insurance companies should be limited to payment for healthcare not covered by the government plan.<br /><!--more--><br />There are two primary goals that I believe a healthcare system should focus on: <br />1. A healthcare system should provide necessary healthcare in an equitable fashion and should limit costs paid by the patients to a level within their ability to pay. This necessary healthcare includes primary care, hospital care, medications, dental care and psychiatric care, as well as nursing home and hospice care. However, currently, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140713035618/%3Ca%20href=" https:>https:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>www.census.gov/<wbr></wbr>newsroom/<wbr></wbr>releases/<wbr></wbr>archives/<wbr></wbr>income_wealth/<wbr></wbr>cb13-165.html</a>"&gt;the American healthcare system does not provide sufficient affordable coverage to all. As of 2012, 48 million Americans lacked health insurance, according to the U.S Census Bureau. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140110020309/%3Ca%20href=" http:>http:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>www.cbo.gov/<wbr></wbr>sites/<wbr></wbr>default/<wbr></wbr>files/<wbr></wbr>cbofiles/<wbr></wbr>attachments/<wbr></wbr>44190_EffectsAffordableCareActHealthInsuranceCoverage_2.pdf</a>"&gt;The implementation of the ACA is expected to reduce this by just 18 million, according to the Congressional Budget Office. This will still leave approximately 30 million without health insurance. The problem of uninsured Americans could be solved by the universal health care system that I'm proposing, which would provide healthcare to all U.S. citizens. <br />2. A healthcare system should promote maximally efficient and cost- effective use of healthcare resources while maintaining quality of care. When consistent with the other goals, individuals should pay some of the the costs of the healthcare services they use consistent with their income and ability to pay. This is necessary to discourage overconsumption of healthcare services and to discourage people from taking actions that increase their risk of health problems. These actions may include some risky activities such as smoking. <br />Neither goal is achieved by the current health care system. Patients are encouraged to over consume health care services because a third party, such as an insurer, often ends up paying the bill. This overconsumption of healthcare can be the result of patient demands for unneeded medical services made without consideration of the cost of the treatment. Healthcare providers are encouraged to over supply healthcare because the fee-for-service payment method used by most of the American healthcare system rewards healthcare providers for each service provided and because consumers of healthcare services have little knowledge of the nature of the care or services provided to them. A healthcare system with a single public health payer, which reimburses providers on a fixed-rate basis, but charges patients fees based on their healthcare use (if they are able to pay), will best be able to create incentives that minimize overconsumption. While any system that provides universal coverage will face overconsumption issues, a system that has patients pay for a portion of their healthcare usage commensurate with their ability to pay will minimize these issues. Fees can serve as a reminder to the patient that there are costs for healthcare services and can act as an incentive to take these costs into account. <br />Fees charged to the patients as part of this system should go into a general healthcare fund, not to the provider. This system would create the positive incentives found in both fee-for-service systems and in fixed-rate systems. I believe this  proposed system would reduce healthcare overconsumption issues because in the current healthcare system insurance plans generally cover a large portion of health expenses, even if the patient can afford to pay more out of pocket. <br />A core way of achieving the goals of providing necessary healthcare in an equitable, as well as in an efficient and cost-effective manner, while maintaining quality care, is through a government insurer with universal, tax-funded coverage. <br />Goal one, providing necessary healthcare in an equitable fashion, would be met because under my proposed public health insurance system, healthcare would be provided to all  with costs commensurate with a patient's ability to pay, The public insurance plan would, however, include co-pays, deductibles, and other fees set based on ability to pay and the nature of the health care provided. These would exist to discourage overuse of health care, discourage use of inferior or more expensive health care options, and to internalize as much of the burden of actions that increase the risk of higher health expenditures. Wealthy individuals would receive much more limited government paid coverage.  I propose that this should be done through attaching a deductible to the government provided basic plan that would be set based on a percentage of the patient's income minus the poverty limit. Those with incomes equal to, or less than, the poverty line will face no deductible. However, those with higher incomes will face gradually higher deductibles. This basic government plan can be supplemented by private insurance and savings. Co-pays could be assessed on treatment methods that are known to have more effective or less expensive alternatives. <br />Goal two, promoting efficiency and cost-effectiveness would be met in three ways. First, under my proposal, with the entire nation on the same healthcare system, there would be economies of scale. A public payer will serve almost all of the patients in the market and, therefore, be able to maximize these economies of scale. With so many private and nonprofit entities providing services in our current healthcare system, there is much redundancy in administrative costs. The administrative costs of an insurer most strongly correlates with its size, as there are many fixed costs in the U.S insurance market. <br />Therefore, it can be expected that public payer administrative costs would be less. For example, the administrative costs of private insurance companies is on average about 14 percent of total expenditures. However, Medicare has administrative costs of about four percent. <br />A second way that the proposed system would be more cost-effective is that a public payer would have have strong bargaining power with health care providers and would be able to negotiate prices downward. This is because almost all health care purchases will be conducted through this payer and any firm that does not negotiate with it will have a strongly limited market share. The potential benefits of this are very high. <br />The third way a public payer would be more efficient is that it would have the ability to significantly influence healthcare and promote cost-effective techniques and methodologies by using its negotiating power. <br />I believe that hospital care in the United States should gradually be transitioned to a public system operated by local governments. Health care provision has multiple issues that make public provision a possibly more efficient option. First of all, hospital markets are very concentrated and have limited competition. A 2011 study found,  that by the Federal Trade Commission's definition, most hospital markets are highly, or very highly, concentrated (Robinson).  In a choice between a private monopolistic market and a public monopoly, the public monopoly will be more accountable to consumers because government officials have to face elections, while the owners of a private monopoly are motivated mostly by profitability.  Also, consumers often lack the knowledge to fully understand the comparative value of the various healthcare options available, so in any market there are many opportunities to profit from this lack of knowledge. Just as there are many economies of scale on the payment side of the healthcare industry, there are many ways that a public provider can become more efficient due to being the main provider in an area.</p>
