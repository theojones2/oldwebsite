The first is post-Keynesian theories like Modern Monetary Theory. These emphasize the role of fiscal policy, and argue that the monetary system is fundamentally a legal construct. For a country with its own, floating currency the only constraints on fiscal policy are inflation and unemployment. If a government keeps its levels of deficit spending too low it can risk unemployment, but if it spends too much it risks inflation. Post-Keynesians treat taxes (and levels of spending) primarily are regulators of aggregate demand and the over-all money supply. Taxes destroy money, spending creates it. There is no "crowding out" of private sector debt caused by government spending. And MMTers/post-Keynesians dispute the role of the money multiplier as commonly understood. Banks can borrow directly from the Fed, and the Fed will expand the monetary base if interest rates slip from targets, making the money multiplier a useless formality with interest rates, and fiscal policy the real drivers of the money supply. It's a continuation of older Keynesian thought, but with a more sophisticated understanding of the monetary system. I think the main limitation on this train of thought is the mechanism through they wish to stabilize the economy. They advocate for a separation between aggregate demand stabilization and employment stabilization -- full employment AND price stability. One commonly proposed mechanism for this is the "job guarantee" wherein a government agency would provide employment to all unemployed people. The macroeconomic justification for this is reasonable, the politics and microeconomics of this is not. It would be an administrative train wreck. There would difficulties with creative socially useful employment in sufficient quantities (particularly when you are running this program in a near-full employment economy). There would be issues with hiring and firing while still maintaining the universal nature of the program. It sounds good in theory but would be hard to put into practice. Also post-Keynesians tend to rely very heavily on discretionary policy by policy makers in their response to fluctuations. This is problematic. Politicians tend to handle this very poorly. They either do what the US and the EU has done with the ongoing economic depression (they are not nearly aggressive enough in their policy making), or they way overspend (like in Venezuela) and engender inflation. The stabilization of the economy should be on autopilot. The second new-ish perspective in economic policy that I have sympathy towards is Market Monetarism. This is an extension of classic monetarism -- the idea that central banks should stabilize the level of growth of the money supply This has benefits over targeting inflation and/or price stability because there are clear ways that central banks can attempt to meet such a target, and a money supply target lacks some of the more arbitrary factors involved with other potential targets. But they bring a twist to this idea. They argue that central banks should target nominal GDP growth instead of the money supply. A prediction market can be used to determine the right level of money to inject into the economy to make this target. It's nice, clean, and mechanistic. A NGDP target as other benefits. It handles supply shocks (like oil price increases) pretty will compared to other targets. Inflation/price stability targeting would advise a massive bout of austerity in response to a supply shock, causing a depression and extreme unemployment. Employment targeting would advise the exact opposite, triggering a wage-price spiral and very high inflation. NGDP targeting would advise a balanced intermediate solution. Where market monetarists fall down is on their very strong reliance on monetary policy. They effectively think the NGDP could be stabilized by mass purchases of finical assets by central banks â€“ quantitative easing on steroids. This is problematic. Monetary policy, particularly when interest rates are very low is quite weak. And the level of purchases by central banks would 1) be very large, 2) involve politically problematic categories of asset, like foreign currency, and the debt of private companies.</p>

<p>I think it is possible to merge these two perspectives. The market monetarists are quite good at defending the NGDP target as a good target for macroeconomic stabilization, but have yet to convince me that monetary policy has what it takes. The post-Keynesians are quite good at defending the proper role of fiscal policy, but their exact policy proposals are problematic. The two ideas can be merged in my opinion. Target NGDP with fiscal policy. Enact a basic income plan, but with the exact levels of payment set based on a meeting the NGDP target. A prediction market can be useful for setting this level. You could even take this further and merge fiscal and monetary policy. Set interest rates at a constant level, and fund government deficits through creating new monetary base.</p>
