<p><em>This post is part of a series <a title="Blog Post Series on the History of Sustainable Energy and Climate Change Politics" href="https://theojones.name/index.php/blog-post-series-on-the-history-of-sustainable-energy-and-climate-change-politics/">on the history of the politics of sustainable energy</a> <br /></em><a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/about/">According to science blogger Mark Hoofnagle</a>, “Denialism is the employment of rhetorical <br />tactics to give the appearance of argument or legitimate debate, when in actuality there is none.” He argues that these techniques are primarily <strong>“conspiracy, selectivity (cherry-picking), fake experts, impossible expectations (also known as moving goalposts), and general fallacies of logic.</strong>” Emphasis as in original source.</p>

<p>Climate scientist Michael Mann states that climate change denialist arguments fall into “six stages of denial”, in his book <em>The Hockey Stick and the Climate Wars: Dispatches from the Front Lines</em>. Climate change denialists have shifted down the stages of denial as the evidence for the mainstream view on climate change has become stronger-- but all six claims are regularly made. I argue that popular works and political commentators are the most likely to be in the first stages of denial and academic works in the social sciences are the most likely to use the arguments in the higher stages. The first stage is claims that argue that “CO2 is not actually increasing”. However, the rise in CO2 claimed by mainstream researchers has been confirmed by study after study and can be predicted by basic chemistry and physics relations. So, denialists have gradually had to abandon this argument. They then switched to claiming, as Mann puts it, “The increase has no impact on the climate since there is no convincing evidence of warming”. The warming effect of CO2 increases is a bit harder to calculate and predict accurately, but decades of  research on climate change since the 1970s has created a scientific consensus that human produced CO2 is causing potentially harmful levels of warming, so this argument has been slowly abandoned.In the next two steps, denialists try to claim that most observed warming is natural: “3) Even if there is warming, it is due to natural causes 4) Even if the warming cannot be explained by natural causes, the human impact is small, and the impact of continued greenhouse gas emissions will be minor.” But humans have been shown to be the cause of almost all climate change. Scientists have been better able to predict the effects of CO 2 emissions and the effects that they will have on the climate. “5) ...the changes are generally going to be good for us 6) ...it's too late to do anything about it , and/or a technological fix is bound to come along...“ These are the most nuanced of the “stages of denial”. All six of the steps in the “stages of denial” have been shown to be incorrect and are considered to be false by the great majority of scientists. Therefore, an argument that makes any of these claims can be classified as climate change denialism. A viewpoint on climate change that disputes these claims of denialists can be interpreted as concurring with the mainstream scientific view.</p>

<p>America should have universal healthcare available to all residents of the country at an affordable price. I believe that the United States healthcare system should be a public insurance system-- one where a government agency is the sole provider of basic health insurance. This basic health coverage should replace Medicare, Medicaid, and the health insurance provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). But some fees should still be charged to patients based on income, ability to pay, and the type of healthcare used. This would prevent overuse of healthcare services. Payments to healthcare providers, such as physicians, should generally be on a fixed salary basis. That is, doctors would be paid a salary, instead of a payment for each appointment or service provided. Additionally, hospital care should be transitioned to a public provider system operated by local governments and funded by the federal government through its insurance system. I also propose a drastic reform of the pharmaceutical industry that includes eliminating patents on drugs and instead funding medical research through government spending, which I will discuss in a follow up post. The role of private insurance companies should be limited to payment for healthcare not covered by the government plan.<br /><!--more--><br />There are two primary goals that I believe a healthcare system should focus on: <br />1. A healthcare system should provide necessary healthcare in an equitable fashion and should limit costs paid by the patients to a level within their ability to pay. This necessary healthcare includes primary care, hospital care, medications, dental care and psychiatric care, as well as nursing home and hospice care. However, currently, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140713035618/%3Ca%20href=" https:>https:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>www.census.gov/<wbr></wbr>newsroom/<wbr></wbr>releases/<wbr></wbr>archives/<wbr></wbr>income_wealth/<wbr></wbr>cb13-165.html</a>"&gt;the American healthcare system does not provide sufficient affordable coverage to all. As of 2012, 48 million Americans lacked health insurance, according to the U.S Census Bureau. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140110020309/%3Ca%20href=" http:>http:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>www.cbo.gov/<wbr></wbr>sites/<wbr></wbr>default/<wbr></wbr>files/<wbr></wbr>cbofiles/<wbr></wbr>attachments/<wbr></wbr>44190_EffectsAffordableCareActHealthInsuranceCoverage_2.pdf</a>"&gt;The implementation of the ACA is expected to reduce this by just 18 million, according to the Congressional Budget Office. This will still leave approximately 30 million without health insurance. The problem of uninsured Americans could be solved by the universal health care system that I'm proposing, which would provide healthcare to all U.S. citizens. <br />2. A healthcare system should promote maximally efficient and cost- effective use of healthcare resources while maintaining quality of care. When consistent with the other goals, individuals should pay some of the the costs of the healthcare services they use consistent with their income and ability to pay. This is necessary to discourage overconsumption of healthcare services and to discourage people from taking actions that increase their risk of health problems. These actions may include some risky activities such as smoking. <br />Neither goal is achieved by the current health care system. Patients are encouraged to over consume health care services because a third party, such as an insurer, often ends up paying the bill. This overconsumption of healthcare can be the result of patient demands for unneeded medical services made without consideration of the cost of the treatment. Healthcare providers are encouraged to over supply healthcare because the fee-for-service payment method used by most of the American healthcare system rewards healthcare providers for each service provided and because consumers of healthcare services have little knowledge of the nature of the care or services provided to them. A healthcare system with a single public health payer, which reimburses providers on a fixed-rate basis, but charges patients fees based on their healthcare use (if they are able to pay), will best be able to create incentives that minimize overconsumption. While any system that provides universal coverage will face overconsumption issues, a system that has patients pay for a portion of their healthcare usage commensurate with their ability to pay will minimize these issues. Fees can serve as a reminder to the patient that there are costs for healthcare services and can act as an incentive to take these costs into account. <br />Fees charged to the patients as part of this system should go into a general healthcare fund, not to the provider. This system would create the positive incentives found in both fee-for-service systems and in fixed-rate systems. I believe this  proposed system would reduce healthcare overconsumption issues because in the current healthcare system insurance plans generally cover a large portion of health expenses, even if the patient can afford to pay more out of pocket. <br />A core way of achieving the goals of providing necessary healthcare in an equitable, as well as in an efficient and cost-effective manner, while maintaining quality care, is through a government insurer with universal, tax-funded coverage. <br />Goal one, providing necessary healthcare in an equitable fashion, would be met because under my proposed public health insurance system, healthcare would be provided to all  with costs commensurate with a patient's ability to pay, The public insurance plan would, however, include co-pays, deductibles, and other fees set based on ability to pay and the nature of the health care provided. These would exist to discourage overuse of health care, discourage use of inferior or more expensive health care options, and to internalize as much of the burden of actions that increase the risk of higher health expenditures. Wealthy individuals would receive much more limited government paid coverage.  I propose that this should be done through attaching a deductible to the government provided basic plan that would be set based on a percentage of the patient's income minus the poverty limit. Those with incomes equal to, or less than, the poverty line will face no deductible. However, those with higher incomes will face gradually higher deductibles. This basic government plan can be supplemented by private insurance and savings. Co-pays could be assessed on treatment methods that are known to have more effective or less expensive alternatives. <br />Goal two, promoting efficiency and cost-effectiveness would be met in three ways. First, under my proposal, with the entire nation on the same healthcare system, there would be economies of scale. A public payer will serve almost all of the patients in the market and, therefore, be able to maximize these economies of scale. With so many private and nonprofit entities providing services in our current healthcare system, there is much redundancy in administrative costs. The administrative costs of an insurer most strongly correlates with its size, as there are many fixed costs in the U.S insurance market. <br />Therefore, it can be expected that public payer administrative costs would be less. For example, the administrative costs of private insurance companies is on average about 14 percent of total expenditures. However, Medicare has administrative costs of about four percent. <br />A second way that the proposed system would be more cost-effective is that a public payer would have have strong bargaining power with health care providers and would be able to negotiate prices downward. This is because almost all health care purchases will be conducted through this payer and any firm that does not negotiate with it will have a strongly limited market share. The potential benefits of this are very high. <br />The third way a public payer would be more efficient is that it would have the ability to significantly influence healthcare and promote cost-effective techniques and methodologies by using its negotiating power. <br />I believe that hospital care in the United States should gradually be transitioned to a public system operated by local governments. Health care provision has multiple issues that make public provision a possibly more efficient option. First of all, hospital markets are very concentrated and have limited competition. A 2011 study found,  that by the Federal Trade Commission's definition, most hospital markets are highly, or very highly, concentrated (Robinson).  In a choice between a private monopolistic market and a public monopoly, the public monopoly will be more accountable to consumers because government officials have to face elections, while the owners of a private monopoly are motivated mostly by profitability.  Also, consumers often lack the knowledge to fully understand the comparative value of the various healthcare options available, so in any market there are many opportunities to profit from this lack of knowledge. Just as there are many economies of scale on the payment side of the healthcare industry, there are many ways that a public provider can become more efficient due to being the main provider in an area.</p>

<p>Nuclear energy is a fuel source that is far superior to the fossil fuels that our economy is currently based on. As I will show in this post  nuclear power produces lower greenhouse gas emissions, is safer and is cheaper than many fossil fuels.</p>

<p>[caption id="attachment_526" align="alignright" width="300"]<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Nuclear_Power_Plant_Cattenom_a.png"></a> Unlike fossil fuel power plants, the only substance leaving the cooling towers of nuclear power plants is water vapour and thus does not pollute the air or cause global warming.

<ol><li><strong>Lower Greenhouse Gas Emissions:  </strong>France with 73% of its power from nuclear has per-capita CO2 emissions three times LOWER then the U.S. Power costs in France are half that of Germany.</li>
    <li><strong>Health and Safety:</strong> The pollution produced by the fossil fuel industry kills more Americans every year than nuclear energy generation has in the entire world in all of history. <!--more-->A study of more than 400 coal power plants by the American Lung Association<a href="http://www.lungusa.org/about-us/our-impact/top-stories/toxic-air-coal-fired-power-plants.html"> found that the pollution from the power plants kill approximately 13,000 people a year</a> or about 20 people a power plant. <a href="http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fatomicinsights.com%2F1996%2F04%2Fchernobyl-health-effects-best-available-data.html&amp;h=jAQH8I97P">The Chernobyl disaster killed 42 people.</a>What the nuclear industry calls their worst disaster in history the coal industry calls "clean coal". Fukushima and Chernobyl were light water reactors from the 1970s based on designs from the 50s. 95% of the radioactive material from Fukushima was contained and there were no fatalities. The failure of the Fukushima reactor was caused by a once in a lifetime magnitude 9.0 earthquake and a 45 foot high tsunami. Three similar but more modern reactors were hit by the same tsunami and earthquake and remained intact. The latest reactor designs can produce even better safety results. Generation III reactors such as Westinghouse Electric's AP1000, which are the most modern designs currently in production have a very small risk of accident.A report by British regulators found that the AP1000 has a less than 1 in ten million chance of undergoing an accident that results in reactor core damage. The risk of a similar failure from a fourth generation reactor design such as a lead-cooled fast reactor is near-negligible. <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2050039-1,00.html">These reactors can also breeder reactors that are much smaller and compact than light water reactors and require much less fuel. In these reactors liquid lead is used to cool the reactor and transfer heat instead of water.</a> These reactors can not produce enough heat to vaporize the lead and cause an explosion. If there is a fuel leak the escaped lead solution will quickly solidify. A lead-cooled fast reactor that can produce enough power for 17,000 households and the fuel needed to run it for over a decade can be the size of a household refrigerator (the equipment to control and monitor the reactor would be the size of a small factory) and kept underground and covered by enough steel and reinforced concrete to contain any failure.</li>
    <li><strong>Cost:</strong> Nuclear power is the cheapest clean energy source and is cost competitive with fossil fuels. <a href="http://www.energy.ca.gov/2007publications/CEC-200-2007-011/CEC-200-2007-011-SD.PDF">According to the California Energy Commission</a> without subsidies nuclear power costs 7.7 cents per kilowatt hour. Coal without subsidies costs 7.4 cents per kilowatt hour. Natural gas and oil cost more than nuclear without subsidies.</li>

            </h2>
                    <p class="reading">
                <span class="vague">3 min read </span>
            </p>
            
<p>I have recently moved the VPS that this blog is hosted on to a Virtualmin install on Ubuntu 12.04. This tutorial shows how I have configured it. Virtualmin is a free program that can install and manage common server services. Among other things it can manage email (defaulting to the</p>

<p>postfix/dovecot servers), web (defaulting to Apache), and mailing lists (using <a class="zem_slink" title="GNU Mailman" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/" target="_blank" rel="homepage">GNU Mailman</a>). For this tutorial I will assume you have a working Ubuntu 12.04 install. I am using the free/open source GPL licensed version of Virtualmin instead of the proprietary version.</p>
<!--more--><h3>Install Virtualmin and Dependencies</h3>
<p>Virtualmin's developers have produced a script that installs Virtualmin and all of its dependencies. Download the install script with the following command.</p>

<p><em>wget <a href="http://software.virtualmin.com/gpl/scripts/install.sh"></a><a href="http://software.virtualmin.com/gpl/scripts/install.sh">http:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>software.virtualmin.com/<wbr></wbr>gpl/<wbr></wbr>scripts/<wbr></wbr>install.sh</a></em></p>

<p>Run the script to install Virtualmin and its dependencies.</p>

<p><em>/bin/sh install.sh</em></p>

<p>Wait while Virtualmin updates and installs.</p>
<h3>Create a Swap File</h3>
<p>Some of the components of the Virtualmin system can cause peaks of memory usage that can overfill the system ram on some low memory installations.The spam and virus checking programs (Spamassin and ClamAV) used by Virtualmin are particularly likely to cause peaks of RAM usage. For this reason, it is a good idea to create a swap file if you haven't created a swap partition during your install of Ubuntu.Most images distributed by VPS hosts do not include swap space. Run the following commands to create a 1GB swap file.</p>

<p><em>fallocate -l 1000M /swapfile</em></p>

<p><em>chmod 600 /swapfile</em></p>

<p><em>mkswap /swapfile</em></p>

<p>Set the swap file to load on boot by adding a line to /etc/fstab</p>

<p><em>Nano /etc/fstab</em></p>

<p>add</p>

<p><em>/swapfile none swap defaults 0 0</em></p>
<h3>Common PHP Extensions</h3>
<p>Curl and PHP5-gd are common PHP extensions that many PHP applications require. Install them with the following commands.<br /><em>apt-get clean && apt-get update && apt-get install php5-curl</em></p>

<p><em>apt-get install php5-gd</em></p>
<h3>Configure Virtualmin</h3>
<p>Now we have a Virtualmin install with all dependencies. Now it is time to configure Virtualmin.</p>

<p>Go to https://<your ip here>:10000/ and run through the Virtualmin configuration wizard.<br /><br />In my experience, the default PHP upload file size limit is too low for many applications. Change the upload settings with the following procedure. Under Services find "PHP 5 Configuration". Then click "Resource Limits".Edit the "Maximum file upload size" textbox. Save your changes.<br /><br /><a class="zem_slink" title="Greylisting" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greylisting" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">Greylisting</a> is a powerful anti-spam technique that exploits the fact that spammers rarely use standards compliant email servers.The standards for the email protocol allow the receiving server to declare that it is temporarily unavailable instead of outright accepting or rejecting a message. If this happens a standards compliant server will wait and then resend the message.Most spambots will not. Greylisting configures the mail server to declare that it is temporarily unavailable the first time that a server that has never delivered an email to you attempts to send an email. Greylisting may delay some of your email but it is one of the most effective anti-spam methods. To enable it follow the following steps.<br />Under "Email Messages" find "Email Greylisting".Click "Install Greylisting". Under "Email Messages" find "Email Greylisting". Click "Enable Greylisting".<br /><br />DKIM is another anti-spam technique that attempts to filter out spoofed email headers. To enable it follow the following steps. Under "Email Messages" find "DomainKeys Identified Mail". Click "install DKIM".<br /><br /><h3>Add Domain Name</h3><br /><br />You now have a fully configured Virtualmin installation. To add a domain name to it follow the following steps  Click "Create Virtual Server".
