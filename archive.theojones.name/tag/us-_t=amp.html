<p>I've noticed that the hard left has a large amount of opposition to modernism and a good dose of what could be described as reactionaryism (the belief in the return to a past state). Sure, this is commonly (and perhaps almost exclusively) associated with the right-wing, but it's a huge element of some newer left-wing points of view. It's common to view reactionaryism solely in terms of classic social issues, and on these points reactionaryism is an inherently right-wing point of view. But there are other elements of policy and on these it's the left that wants to resist/reverse social progress. Additionally, this is one of the reasons why liberalism is NOT equivalent to progressivism/leftism. It's only an oddity of US politics that has made it seem like this is true. The range of political possibilities in the United States has be limited in such a way as to leave both progressives and liberals in agreement on all major issues of politics. I think this is beginning to change, and there will become an increasingly strong distinction between these two ideologies in the future. I would commit that within the next 10 or so years this will become a very noticeable distinction -- similar to the one that splits conservatives and libertarians. The dispute is fundamentally over the three pillars of enlightenment liberalism 1) science as the arbitrator of knowledge,2) democracy and due process as the arbitrator of political outcomes, and 3) individual liberty. Here are a few of the reactionary tendencies in the left wing viewpoint</p>
<ol><li>A dislike of science. This can be seen in issues like the debate over GMO's and similar conflicts. This can also be seen in the broader world of ideology. The world of left-leaning academic theory is almost overwhelmingly skeptical of the view that human society can be studied scientifically using the (largely quantative) methods commonly associated with the natural sciences. At the very least, this involves an emphasis on "other ways of knowing", and on the self-reported and analyzed "lived experiences" of people. This comes under such names as "structuralism" in the literature. The most extreme form of this comes under such names as post-structuralism and postmodernism and outright disputes the primacy of science even in the realm of the natural sciences, like physics and biology. This is of, course a highly problematic position, but is not at all rare in the world of diversity studies, and other left-leaning elements of the humanities.</li>
<li><p>Persistent clashes with freedom of speech. A lot of members of the modern left don't recognize the liberal distinction between speech and action. They have resurrected the ancient view that offensive speech or an attack on personal honor is an equivalent to physical violence. They act as if the advocacy of a course of action, or the belief that a course of action is within one's rights, or the attempt to participate in the political process, is equivalent to actually doing the action in question. This treatment of disagreeable speech as an equivalent of a physical attack also materializes into things like "trigger warnings" and the "safe place" movement. This bodes poorly for the underlying conception of democracy. Democracy feeds on public contestability and public debate of possible options. The vast majority of policy proposals will prove to be wrongheaded, and will be rightly rejected. But the process of free discourse and debate is absolutely essential to this process. Enlightenment civic republicanism came into existence in about the same time as science, because the two are innately linked. Both rely on decentralized finding of knowledge. In the case of science, this is for finding facts, in the case of democracy this is for determining how to run society. An attack on free speech is a full scale attack on both.</p></li>
<li><p>A neo-luddite view of technology and industrialization. Widespread industrialization and deployment of technology has vastly improved the standard of living of the typical person. However, many elements of the hard left want to return to a "small is beautiful" way of running the economy. An emphasis is put on small businesses and cooperatives. Some want a small scale and decentralized economy that looks a lot like the pre-industrial world. Its states' rights for progressives. And equally absurd. Despite its flaws, major firms can put in place a large degree of economic planning and stability that smaller firms cannot. They can leverage economies of scale, and they have vast efficiency improvements over smaller firms when they produce a uniform product Small is not efficient.</p></li>

<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I am strongly against the wider deployment of biofuels. There are the obvious interactions between biofuel production and food prices, and biofuel production is largely responsible for the 2007 price crisis. Other than the large-scale humanitarian reasons to oppose biofuel production as a serious alternative energy, there is also the fact that even considering very generous projections, the fuel source is unlikely to ever produce a large amount of the world's energy supply. Compared to the land they take up, plants are just extremely efficient energy producers. This blog post will show how is simply not possible with anything like current technology to meet even a substantial amount of the world's energy needs with biofuels. I will start with a generous estimate of the maximum possible biomass energy production come out of agricultural land. First are some quick assumptions. The first is that world's future energy supply will need to provide a developed nation level of energy use to a population of about 9 billion people. Furthermore, this will at the very least require power production amounting to about 5000 W per person on average. The current US power consumption amounts to about 10,000 W on average. Now let's calculate based on highly favorable assumptions how much of the world's energy supply biomass energy could reasonably provide.<br /></span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Let's first start the total surface area of the Earth, <a href="http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhypertextbook.com%2Ffacts%2F2001%2FDanielChen.shtml&amp;date=2015-05-24">which is about 361,800,000 square kilometers</a>. How much of this is reasonably available to agriculture? Only 150,000,000 square kilometers is land and only some of this land is actually useful for agriculture. So when you adjust you get a total useful percentage of the Earth's land surface area of <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v461/n7263/full/461472a.html">about 15%</a>. Now, that estimate, would result in estimate of global available crop land of substantially less than half a hectare, or about 1 acre of cropland per person. However, that estimate is based on many environmental constraints. Let's ignore them. The purpose of this article let's pretend we want to maximize biofuel production regardless of any environmental constraints, even if it means destroying almost every natural ecosystem around. Let's pave over every roughly arable plot of land. When you subtract out on the uninhabitable land or land is otherwise useless to large-scale agriculture and divide by the future expected population of 9 billion, <a href="http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.zo.utexas.edu%2Fcourses%2FTHOC%2Fland.html&amp;date=2015-05-25">you get an area of about one hectare (~2 acres) of land per person</a>. If all this land were converted to biofuel production, how much energy could it produce? Of course, this will be a highly generous estimate. One hectare is 10,000 square meters. How much energy do biofuel crops produced per square meter? Depends on the crop. <a href="http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.withouthotair.com%2FcD%2Fpage_284.shtml&amp;date=2015-05-25">Corn grown in the United States converted to ethanol produces about 0.02 watts of energy per square meter</a>. When scaled up across the per-person hectare, this amounts to about 200W per person. This is a straight up puny amount of energy production compared to the total world needs. What about improved technology? The previous link suggests that theoretical cellulosic ethanol system could deliver about 0.2 watts per square meter. This gives a somewhat reasonable contribution to overall energy production. However, such a large number as a product of a very generous estimate, and predicts some technology that only exists on paper. And remember, that per person amount is based on an assumption where all reasonably useful land is being devoted voted to the purpose. Already, most reasonably usable agricultural land is already being used for food production. From page 21 of<br /></span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 36pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong><em>About 12 % of the global land surface is currently under crop cultivation (Foley et al., 2005; Ramankutty et al. 2008). The allowed 3 % expansion (approximately 400 Mha) to the level we propose as a land system boundary will most likely be reached over the coming decades,and includes suitable land that is not either currently cultivated or is under forest cover – e.g., abandoned cropland in Europe, North America and the former Soviet Union and some areas of Africa's savannas and South America's cerrado
</em></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Overall, is clear that, at least with current technology biofuels will be extremely unlikely to provide a substantial contribution to the overall substantial energy production. The current programs of subsidies for biofuel production should be immediately phased out. It will be extremely unlikely to contribute to a substantial energy future. In the meantime, biofuel production will compete with food production while producing very little economic value. Because of this competition with food production and because of the tendencies for this competition increase prices and inflation, I furthermore think that even privately funded biofuel production should be outlawed on any commercial, near commercial, or industrial scale. The small scale production that does continue should be heavily regulated, should be forced to use feed stocks that have no risk of competition with food supplies, and should be heavily taxed (due to the imperfections of regulation in catching all unwanted use of the tech). </span></p>

<p>A <a href="http://eprints.nottingham.ac.uk/2236/">study published this month</a> ,<em>Climate change on Twitter: topics, communities and conversations about the 2013 IPCC report</em>, looked into the debate about climate change on Twitter around the release of the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change assessment.</p>

<p>They analysed the content of  tweets that mentioned the IPCC. Most Twitter posts on climate change  Among their findings is the discovery of a clear political polarization in online discussions of this issue. The discussions largely fit into four topics, "relation to science, political campaigns, geography, and social meanings of climate change". Of particular frequency in this discussion is the debate over the carbon tax bill in Australia. The debate over the accuracy of the science strongly follows these political lines. The following two example tweets given in the paper illustrate this.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <a href="Australian.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#Australian</a> PM thinks that if he doesn't read the <a href="IPCC.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#IPCC</a> report then <a href="climatechange.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#climatechange</a> is still crap. That's the way this government works.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>In the United States tweets followed liberal and conservative lines with conservative tweets outnumbering liberal ones two to one. The authors state that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The dominance of conservative-leaning hashtags in the US provide support for the theory that the country’s climate debate is in danger of becoming so polarized as to be described as a “logic schism”, in a similar manner to struggles over President Obama’s healthcare program.</p>
