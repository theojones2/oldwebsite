      <description><![CDATA[<div>
        <p>In previous posts I have mentioned George Lakoff's ideas about how misunderstanding systemic causation contributes to science denialism. He describes <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/george-lakoff/sandy-climate-change_b_2042871.html">his ideas at HuffPo</a> and academically in <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17524030903529749">a 2010 paper </a>(as usual, full citation at end of post). Lakoff differentiates between two types of causation; systemic and direct. Direct causation is the type of non-probablistic causation that occurs when you shove a box. The box moves, and it will move pretty much every time you shove it. Systemic causation instead involves shifting the probability distribution of events. Climate change does not make a hurricane of a given strength at a given location an unvoidable occurance, in the same way that pushing the box make its movement unavoidable. However, it does make certan types of hurricanes more likely, and therefore can be said to cause hurricanes. A lot of science involves systemic causation. And the fields of science where the causation involved is the most systemic and probabilistic tend to be the biggest denialism magnets. Think climate change or evolution. Why does the role of systemic causation tend to correlate with tendiencies to deny the science? Lakoff seems to think the cause is political ideology.  In his opinion, conservative/libertarian political beliefs tend to have more difficulties with systemic causation. </p><p>However, I doubt this ideological explanation. It is wrong (and perhaps actively dangerous)  for roughly the reasons that <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1744-540X.2007.00466.x/abstract;jsessionid=EB663E5ADD49D613AFCC5CED88563015.f02t03">Steve Pinker points out</a>. Conservatives use arguements that reily on systemic causation all the time, particulary in regards to economic policy. And it is particulary dangerous to treat ideological framing as a goal of political discourse, instead of an all to common discription of it. Such a goal involves a brain-rotting mixing of normative goals and positive description of how the world works. Read Lakoff's writings on GMOs and nuclear energy to see the mind-rot in action.  </p><p>Instead I propose two other explinations of how systemic causation relates to denialism</p><ol><li>The fact that denialism relies on the asymmetry of difficulty in creating reasonable sounding, but incorrect arguements, and refuting them. </li>
<li>The fact that complex systems create emergent properties that often go aganist the intuitions and herististuics that underlie a lot of human reasoning.</li>
</ol><p>Lets start with point one.</p><p><img src="http://www.theojones.name/file/339c444f4e618040977c19a343fd4d1c" alt="The amount of energy necessary to refute bullshit is an order of magnitude bigger than to produce it width=" height="239"></p><p><em>Image via <a href="https://jasonapril.wordpress.com/2014/06/05/the-amount-of-energy-necessary-to-refute-bullshit/"></a><a href="https://jasonapril.wordpress.com/2014/06/05/the-amount-of-energy-necessary-to-refute-bullshit/">https:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>jasonapril.wordpress.com/<wbr></wbr>2014/<wbr></wbr>06/<wbr></wbr>05/<wbr></wbr>the-amount-of-energy-necessary-to-refute-bullshit/<wbr></wbr></a></em></p><p> </p><p>The claims that climate change deniers and creationists and their ilk make reily on very subtle misconseptions. The misconceptions are pretty beleiveable to a non-expert, and a full explination of why the misconception is wrong can take a lot of effort. Go to SKS or a similar website that rebuts climate change deniers. Look at the section where they list their rebuttials to these arguements <a href="http://www.skepticalscience.com/argument.php"></a><a href="http://www.skepticalscience.com/argument.php">http:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>www.skepticalscience.com/<wbr></wbr>argument.php</a> . Note that the rebuttal is usually at least a few times longer than the claim itself.  But it is only a certan type of science that follows the bullshit asymtery rule. Sciences that involve a lot of systemic causation. Complex systems can behave in some pretty subtle ways. Ways that are not ovious, and that take a lot of effort to understand and predict. Due to the Dunning-Kruger effect, and such, it can take quite a bit of knowledge to even be able tell good arguements from bad ones. Add bias, and the generally poor quality of human reasoning, and it becomes easy to talk from <a href="http://imgur.com/cNFqi">Mt. Stupid</a>. </p><p>But when was the last time you saw a math denialist? Not recently? The reason for that is the fact that math does not follow the bullshit asymmetry rule. Its hard to come up with a reasonable sounding, but wrong mathmatical arguement. And when you do come up with one the reason why it is wrong is usually pretty simple. It has actually  become a bit of a game in the math community to come up with invalid "proofs" that seem pleasing. Usually the "proof" is of a clearly absurd claim, like 1=2. Take the following example from Wikipedia. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_fallacy#Division_by_zero"></a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_fallacy#Division_by_zero">https:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>en.wikipedia.org/<wbr></wbr>wiki/<wbr></wbr>Mathematical_fallacy#Division_by_zero</a></p><p>Let a and b be be equal non-zero quantities.</p><p>$$a=b$$</p><p>Multiply  both sides of the above equation by a. This results in </p><p>$$a^2 = ab$$</p><p>Subtract </p><p>$$b^2$$</p><p>from both sides, resulting in </p><p>$$a^2 - b^2 = ab - b^2$$</p><p>Factor both sides</p><p>$$(a-b)(a+b) = b(a-b)$$ </p><p>Divide both sides by </p><p>$$(a-b) $$</p><p>Resulting in </p><p>$$a + b = b$$ </p><p>Because we know that a = b</p><p>$$ b + b = b $$ </p><p>$$2b = b$ </p><p>$$2 = 1$$ </p><p>The issue with this is simple, there was an implicit division by zero in the "proof" </p><p> </p><p><a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/climatechange" class="p-category" rel="tag">#climatechange</a> <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/denialism" class="p-category" rel="tag">#denialism</a> <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/science" class="p-category" rel="tag">#science</a> <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/lakoff" class="p-category" rel="tag">#lakoff</a> </p><p>Lakoff, George.

<p>I've noticed that the hard left has a large amount of opposition to modernism and a good dose of what could be described as reactionaryism (the belief in the return to a past state). Sure, this is commonly (and perhaps almost exclusively) associated with the right-wing, but it's a huge element of some newer left-wing points of view. It's common to view reactionaryism solely in terms of classic social issues, and on these points reactionaryism is an inherently right-wing point of view. But there are other elements of policy and on these it's the left that wants to resist/reverse social progress. Additionally, this is one of the reasons why liberalism is NOT equivalent to progressivism/leftism. It's only an oddity of US politics that has made it seem like this is true. The range of political possibilities in the United States has be limited in such a way as to leave both progressives and liberals in agreement on all major issues of politics. I think this is beginning to change, and there will become an increasingly strong distinction between these two ideologies in the future. I would commit that within the next 10 or so years this will become a very noticeable distinction -- similar to the one that splits conservatives and libertarians. The dispute is fundamentally over the three pillars of enlightenment liberalism 1) science as the arbitrator of knowledge,2) democracy and due process as the arbitrator of political outcomes, and 3) individual liberty. Here are a few of the reactionary tendencies in the left wing viewpoint</p>
<ol><li>A dislike of science. This can be seen in issues like the debate over GMO's and similar conflicts. This can also be seen in the broader world of ideology. The world of left-leaning academic theory is almost overwhelmingly skeptical of the view that human society can be studied scientifically using the (largely quantative) methods commonly associated with the natural sciences. At the very least, this involves an emphasis on "other ways of knowing", and on the self-reported and analyzed "lived experiences" of people. This comes under such names as "structuralism" in the literature. The most extreme form of this comes under such names as post-structuralism and postmodernism and outright disputes the primacy of science even in the realm of the natural sciences, like physics and biology. This is of, course a highly problematic position, but is not at all rare in the world of diversity studies, and other left-leaning elements of the humanities.</li>
<li><p>Persistent clashes with freedom of speech. A lot of members of the modern left don't recognize the liberal distinction between speech and action. They have resurrected the ancient view that offensive speech or an attack on personal honor is an equivalent to physical violence. They act as if the advocacy of a course of action, or the belief that a course of action is within one's rights, or the attempt to participate in the political process, is equivalent to actually doing the action in question. This treatment of disagreeable speech as an equivalent of a physical attack also materializes into things like "trigger warnings" and the "safe place" movement. This bodes poorly for the underlying conception of democracy. Democracy feeds on public contestability and public debate of possible options. The vast majority of policy proposals will prove to be wrongheaded, and will be rightly rejected. But the process of free discourse and debate is absolutely essential to this process. Enlightenment civic republicanism came into existence in about the same time as science, because the two are innately linked. Both rely on decentralized finding of knowledge. In the case of science, this is for finding facts, in the case of democracy this is for determining how to run society. An attack on free speech is a full scale attack on both.</p></li>
<li><p>A neo-luddite view of technology and industrialization. Widespread industrialization and deployment of technology has vastly improved the standard of living of the typical person. However, many elements of the hard left want to return to a "small is beautiful" way of running the economy. An emphasis is put on small businesses and cooperatives. Some want a small scale and decentralized economy that looks a lot like the pre-industrial world. Its states' rights for progressives. And equally absurd. Despite its flaws, major firms can put in place a large degree of economic planning and stability that smaller firms cannot. They can leverage economies of scale, and they have vast efficiency improvements over smaller firms when they produce a uniform product Small is not efficient.</p></li>

This applies even for human society. My one difference from this view is the belief that just raw observation isn't sufficient. There is the need for bridge assumptions in order to translate mere observations into explanatory theories and moral judgements. Additionally, some basic metaphysical assumptions are needed. The list of such assumptions should be as short as possible, and as much of the heavy lifting should be loaded on to observation. But these bridge assumptions are needed as just pure observation is not enough. A pile of data is not a theory and is not an explanation of the world. Mere observation is not sufficient to produce knowledge. Results need to be merged into something greater than their parts. Correlations between different results need to be drawn together into a greater theory. All this requires interpretation, and there needs to be rules that to interpretation. Likewise there have to be a few basic assumptions about how the world works in order to make science workable. Ethics is another thing where mere data isn't enough. The is-ought gap needs to be bridged. Therefore a basic assumption about how to turn facts about how the world is to ethical judgments is needed. As follows in the rest of this blog post is a rough overview of what my basic assumptions about the world is like. Additionally, a positivist/empiricist worldview without bridge assumptions will be unavoidably self-contradictory. There is no way that empiricism itself can be confirmed through mere observation.</p>
<ol><li>Physicalism --- all objects that exist follow laws of physics that exist independently of the subjective views of observers. My preferred variant of this is the mathematical universe hypothesis, the idea that the universe is a mathematical structure.</li>
    <li>The basic rules of logic.</li>
    <li>The scientific method. For this I prefer something along the lines of Popperlian falseificationsim. This is the idea that science is the repeated refinement of falsifiable theories through observation.</li>
    <li>A rule regarding ethics. I prefer preference utilitarianism – the idea that the moral set of actions is the one that results in the longest long-run preference satisfaction when aggregated over all individuals.</li>

      <title>Mentioning the Possibility of Geoengineering Efforts Might Induce More Acceptance of Climate Change</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div>
        
<p><a href="http://www.culturalcognition.net/browse-papers/geoengineering-and-the-science-communication-environment-a-c.html">A new study published in <em>Annals of the AAPS</em> suggests</a>that providing information about the possibility of geoengineering might cause individuals to accept climate change. The authors speculate that it has to do with ideology -- conservatives (or hierarchical-individualists as the paper calls them) tend to put a lot of faith in business and industry, and a conventional presentation of the climate change issue tends to be at least somewhat in opposition to business. Geoengennering uses the tools of industry and thus it might be more palatable to conservatives. That line of reasoning makes me wonder if it was a mistake for activists to emphasize renewable energy as the main alternative to fossil fuels. Nuclear might be more favorable for conservatives. The abstract of the paper reads</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We conducted a two-nation study (United States, n = 1500; England, n = 1500) to test a novel theory of science communication. The cultural cognition thesis posits that individuals make extensive reliance on cultural meanings in forming perceptions of risk. The logic of the cultural cognition thesis suggests the potential value of a distinctive two-channel science communication strategy that combines information content (“Channel 1”) with cultural meanings (“Channel 2”) selected to promote open-minded assessment of information across diverse communities. In the study, scientific information content on climate change was held constant while the cultural meaning of that information was experimentally manipulated. Consistent with the study hypotheses, we found that making citizens aware of the potential contribution of geoengineering as a supplement to restriction of CO2 emissions helps to offset cultural polarization over the validity of climate-change science. We also tested the hypothesis, derived from competing models of science communication, that exposure to information on geoengineering would provoke discounting of climate-change risks generally. Contrary to this hypothesis, we found that subjects exposed to information about geoengineering were slightly more concerned about climate change risks than those assigned to a control condition.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.skepticalscience.com/kahan-geoeng-polar.html">SKS' Andy Skuce notes</a> that their framing of geoengineering is pretty slanted. The article presented to participants is the following.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theojones.name/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/kahangeo1.jpg"><img class=" size-full wp-image-2120 alignnone" src="http://www.theojones.name/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/kahangeo1.jpg" alt="kahangeo1" width="545" height="702"></a></p>

<p>The techniques vary a lot, but I generally consider geoengineering better than just bearing the costs of severe climate change and adapting, but worse than actually preventing emissions. The other thing is that the most practical/cheapest geoengineering schemes tend to be the ones with the most adverse impacts. I also think that a geoengineering project will be deployed at some point, as I don't see a full mitigation of CO2 emissions happening anything soon with enough strength to avoid dangerous levels of climate change. The scale of the shift in energy infrastructure is on the scale of the investment that happened to fight world war II, and I see no indication that policy makers are willing to commit to that type of investment quickly enough to change things (even though they should).</p>

<p>I've been having an issue with a<a href="http://www.theojones.name/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Capture.png"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1818" src="http://www.theojones.name/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Capture-300x261.png" alt="Capture" width="300" height="261"></a> temporary freeze of my Windows 8.1 computer followed shortly by very high disk read-write activity. I took a while, but I pinned the issue down to swapping. In short, the memory management on Windows is terrible compared to that of Linux. And a Windows computer (or at least mine) will start swapping if you look at it the wrong way -- even if there are gigabytes of RAM left. The only way to fix this is to eliminate the swap file. This should be only done if there is a lot of ram on the system in question -- because if RAM runs out while swapping is off programs are going to crash.</p>

<p>To turn off swapping do the following: <br /> 1. Go to the Control Panel.  Find All control panel items &gt; System<br /> 2. Click on "Advanced system settings"<br /> 3. Under performance, click on "settings"<br /> 4. Go to the "Advanced" tab<br /> 5. Under Virtual memory, click on Change<br /> 6. Disable the "Automatically manage paging file size for all drives" check box<br /> 7. Zero it out.</p>

<p>The startup called <a href="https://thegrid.io/">thegrid</a> is releasing a product that is effectively a content management system, roughly similar in functionality to WordPress and such. This startup seems to be promising is software that can handle website design task in a more intelligent way than a traditional template-filling content management system. The company is accepting preorders and has done a pretty intensive advertising campaign on Facebook and other social media and has gotten quite a bit of media attention. They haven't released a beta of it yet, but when they do have something released I'll write a follow-up article saying what I think of it. But just seeing their advertising material on the articles have been written about it I have a few thoughts so far.</p>
<ul><li> This is the type of software that is either going to be absolutely terrible or is going to be very good. I have signed up for the pre order but I wouldn't recommend paying for the preorder unless you are willing to be disappointed. However, it might be worth it you're willing to take a risk, as they do give some discounts for later usage to those who preorder. Having not seen an actual release of this software, I can't recommend it yet. 
</li><li> I seriously doubt that it's going to replace WordPress on this website (unless it has some very impressive features, just on account of the level of commitment I've put into the Wordpress platform already. But it may replace Wordpress as my general go to recommendation for novice computer users wanting to create a website and if it's functional it might be the type of software I use for some new websites.
</li><li>There is a serious market for content management systems are easy to use for not computer types. I think this is the main reason why content silos like Twitter or Facebook or such have become popular over traditional websites. Even with good content management systems like WordPress running a website is pretty tough. If thegrid can improve on this situation they will have a good future.
</li><li>My biggest criticism of what I've seen so far from thegrid that their software, from what it seems, is going to be proprietary and closed source. This is not good. And this has the potential to bring up fundamentally the same issues that occur with the likes of Facebook and Twitter. The upside of their design is that it seems like their software does output static files that can be hosted on other platforms and which are relatively easy to migrate between content management systems. The output format appears to be compatible with Jekyl. But for any platform I use for mission critical stuff, or projects like this blog where I put large amounts of time into it, open source Free Software (in the RMS way) is a must. The fact that thegrid software looks like it will be proprietary severely limits the use cases that I have for it. For a program like this the ability to leave their platform about undue stress is as important as the functionality that their platform provides. I do not want to be trapped in another content silo.
</li><li>Looking at their list of developers; their team seems experienced. It seems like it is within in their skill to deliver on what they are promising. It does not look like this is going to be one of the scams that has plagued crowd sourcing efforts.
</li><li>I really don't like their buzzword filled way of describing their product. They like to use words and phrases like "artificial intelligence" and "websites that design themselves" to really mean "content management system". This makes me substantially skeptical of their product.
</li><li>They have released a few sample websites designed with their engine. These websites seemed generally pretty clean in terms of layout generally have no major design issues. However, layout does seem substantially different in your typical blog or personal website.
</li><li>For this type of thing, the level of customizability is going to be pretty critical. If their engine only has a few possible layouts and designs that can do it's going to be limited to the world of novice users who lack the technical skill in use anything better, or people working on websites so simple they have no use for anything more sophisticated.
</li><li>It seems like they are trying to shake up some of the more fundamental parts of how CMSes function. Their way of handling themes is radically different than the typical implementation. This type of exploration can on
</li><li>A lot of commentators on this, and to some extent developers of thegrid themselves, think that this type of program will replace the role of web designers. I strongly doubt this, they may come up with a way to automate some of the more routine tests that web designers do, but fundamentally creative work still require humans at least to be done with perfection. The best this type of program can hope to do is to leverage the worse is better effect -the fact that her sound the desired functionality can often be delivered by 20% of the effort. This will not be a threat to most web designers, just as the role of cheap and efficient automated translation by services like Google Translate, is not a threat to human translators. This type of software will either be a help to web designers by simplifying some more routine tasks, and/or it will be the type of software used in markets where people can't afford the full effort of a web designer. Web designers and other creative workers will keep their jobs, improved content management systems or not.</li></ul><p><a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/freesoftware" class="p-category" rel="tag">#freesoftware</a> <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/googletranslate" class="p-category" rel="tag">#googletranslate</a> <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/rms" class="p-category" rel="tag">#rms</a> <a href="http://www.theojones.name/tag/scienceandtech" class="p-category" rel="tag">#scienceandtech</a></p></div>]]></description>

      <title>Why 100+ Mile Range TV Antennas Do Not Exist</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div>
        
<p>I'm in the market for an over-the-air TV antenna to go with a TV tuner, and while searching I've noticed more than a few sellers advertising antennas that can get ranges as high as 150 miles.   [caption id="attachment_1440" align="alignright" width="300"]<a href="http://www.theojones.name/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1802424443_21761d4caa_o.jpg"><img src="http://www.theojones.name/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1802424443_21761d4caa_o-300x213.jpg" alt="Image via Flickr user  anomalous4 &lt;a href=" https:>https:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>flic.kr/<wbr></wbr>p/<wbr></wbr>3KgTZv</a>" width="300" height="213" class="size-medium wp-image-1440" /&gt; Image via Flickr user  anomalous4<br /><a href="https://flic.kr/p/3KgTZv%5B/caption%5DSuch">https:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>flic.kr/<wbr></wbr>p/<wbr></wbr>3KgTZv[/<wbr></wbr>caption]Such</a> a thing would be neat as it would allow me reach signals from other cities. But it is too good to be true. Such a device would violate the laws of physics considering the methods used to broadcast TV signals. You will be unlikely to find an antenna that gets more than 60 miles of range, and getting more than 50 miles will come at a high price premium. However, there are lots of people who seem to have fallen for this scam and brought these devices. There are two clear issues that prevent the creation of such a device, at least at a reasonable price. The first is the inverse-square law  of light. Even assuming a flat Earth, a radio signal declines in proportion to square of the distance. Because TV broadcasts are information rich, the antenna needs to catch a lot of information from the broadcast. But the strength of the signal rapidly declines as the broadcast gets farther away. And as there are three dimensions of space that the signal is spreading out in, this change isn't merely linear -- its quadratic.  When the distance doubles the signal (and the cost of picking it up) quadruples. When the distance doubles, the signal reduces nine-fold, when the distance quadruples the signal reduces 16 fold.   There is a second, even more restrictive limit on the creation of a long range antenna -- the fact that the earth is curved. This curvature enforces a line of sight on radio transmissions and therefore sets a maximum range for radio transmissions. Were the broadcasting station merely suspended in space the signal would go out evenly in all directions. However, in the real world, the Earth provides an obstruction. Therefore, the signal is directional, and as the recipient of the signal moves farther away the curvature of the Earth means that he is facing in a direction that is blocked by the Earth. Therefore the recipient is unable to receive the signal past the line of sight.</p>

      <title>More Irrational Ebola Panic: 30 Year Old Ohio Small Business Shuts Down Because an Ebola Victim Shopped There</title>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/09/us/ebola-store-ohio-bridal-shop-where-ebola-patient-shopped-will-close.html?_r=0">According to the New York Times, a small business bridal store in Ohio has closed its doors</a>due to public concern due to Ebola. A victim of the virus shopped there while infected but asymptomatic (and therefore non-contagious). [caption id="attachment_1443" align="alignright" width="300"]<a href="http://www.theojones.name/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/2537685236_0eb9a6c92f_o.jpg"><img src="http://www.theojones.name/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/2537685236_0eb9a6c92f_o-300x138.jpg" alt="Image via CDC." width="300" height="138" class="size-medium wp-image-1443"></a> Image via CDC.[/caption]The store replaced its inventory and conducted an intensive cleaning and when it reopened after the cleaning it had the support of a number of local officials. However, the fact that there was no reasonable threat to the public didn't stop people from avoiding the store because of its Ebola "connection". The sales of the store halved after the re-opening. This store is a victim of a public that does not understand basic science. It is the victim  of irrational paranoia over an extremely rare virus. A basic understand of the facts of medicine would give a typical individual little to fear in such a situation. Only two people have caught the virus in the United States and the clear facts of the biology of the virus show that the infected individual was not contagious. The fact that irrational parinoa destroyed that small business is outrageous.</p>

      <title>Intel's Donation to Diversity Efforts Will Not Remove the Taint Of Sexism in the Company</title>

<p>A few months ago Intel decided to take a pro-Gamergate stance and the company pulled advertisements from anti-Gamergate publications. It was clear to everyone (except perhaps for Intel's marketing department) that siding with a movement with a severe problem of harassment of women in the tech industry and sexism would damage the company's image. And of course, it did. [caption id="attachment_1427" align="alignright" width="300"]<a href="http://www.theojones.name/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/4290983579_ed16d588c9_o.jpg"><img src="http://www.theojones.name/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/4290983579_ed16d588c9_o-300x225.jpg" alt="Intel will sell fewer of these.

Through direct builds of my own and advice to friends and relatives, I was involved in a number of computer purchases since this incident. All run AMD CPUs. The Intel backing of Gamergate was a non-trivial part of this decision. Intel now has a problem, a problem that they tried to fix by throwing money at the issue. Today <a href="http://arstechnica.com/business/2015/01/intel-pledges-300-million-to-improve-diversity-in-tech/">Intel announced their intent to donate $300 million to tech diversity initiatives</a>. However, this is not sufficient to relieve Intel of their issue. The fact that Intel would not only back a toxic movement such as GG, but also back one of their most toxic efforts (an attempt to retaliate against journalists who published articles that GG did not like) indicates a severe problem at Intel's culture. A problem that will take much more than money to fix, and until Intel does that, this scandal will be a black mark on the company's record.</p>
