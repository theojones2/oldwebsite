<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/09/us/ebola-store-ohio-bridal-shop-where-ebola-patient-shopped-will-close.html?_r=0">According to the New York Times, a small business bridal store in Ohio has closed its doors</a>due to public concern due to Ebola. A victim of the virus shopped there while infected but asymptomatic (and therefore non-contagious). [caption id="attachment_1443" align="alignright" width="300"]<a href="http://www.theojones.name/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/2537685236_0eb9a6c92f_o.jpg"><img src="http://www.theojones.name/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/2537685236_0eb9a6c92f_o-300x138.jpg" alt="Image via CDC." width="300" height="138" class="size-medium wp-image-1443"></a> Image via CDC.[/caption]The store replaced its inventory and conducted an intensive cleaning and when it reopened after the cleaning it had the support of a number of local officials. However, the fact that there was no reasonable threat to the public didn't stop people from avoiding the store because of its Ebola "connection". The sales of the store halved after the re-opening. This store is a victim of a public that does not understand basic science. It is the victim  of irrational paranoia over an extremely rare virus. A basic understand of the facts of medicine would give a typical individual little to fear in such a situation. Only two people have caught the virus in the United States and the clear facts of the biology of the virus show that the infected individual was not contagious. The fact that irrational parinoa destroyed that small business is outrageous.</p>

<p>A few months ago Intel decided to take a pro-Gamergate stance and the company pulled advertisements from anti-Gamergate publications. It was clear to everyone (except perhaps for Intel's marketing department) that siding with a movement with a severe problem of harassment of women in the tech industry and sexism would damage the company's image. And of course, it did. [caption id="attachment_1427" align="alignright" width="300"]<a href="http://www.theojones.name/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/4290983579_ed16d588c9_o.jpg"><img src="http://www.theojones.name/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/4290983579_ed16d588c9_o-300x225.jpg" alt="Intel will sell fewer of these.

Image via Flickr user  Leonardo Rizzi<br /><a href="https://flic.kr/p/7xbpVv%5B/caption%5DIntel">https:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>flic.kr/<wbr></wbr>p/<wbr></wbr>7xbpVv[/<wbr></wbr>caption]Intel</a> received an immediate backlash, and Intel's reputation with OEMs and consumers was damaged as a result. Through direct builds of my own and advice to friends and relatives, I was involved in a number of computer purchases since this incident. All run AMD CPUs. The Intel backing of Gamergate was a non-trivial part of this decision. Intel now has a problem, a problem that they tried to fix by throwing money at the issue. Today <a href="http://arstechnica.com/business/2015/01/intel-pledges-300-million-to-improve-diversity-in-tech/">Intel announced their intent to donate $300 million to tech diversity initiatives</a>. However, this is not sufficient to relieve Intel of their issue. The fact that Intel would not only back a toxic movement such as GG, but also back one of their most toxic efforts (an attempt to retaliate against journalists who published articles that GG did not like) indicates a severe problem at Intel's culture. A problem that will take much more than money to fix, and until Intel does that, this scandal will be a black mark on the company's record.</p>
