            <p><em>Halbig vs. Burwell</em> <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2014/06/26/1309717/-ACA-Signups-Halbig-v-Burwell-Potential-Disaster-Ahead">is a case making its way through the courts involving the Affordable Care Act subsidies</a> for individual insurance plans. It seems that the raw wording of the of the Act seems to limit the subsidies to just the exchanges that are ran by state governments i.e not healthcare.gov (see below for the relevant text of the law) However, the subsidies could still be salvaged if it could be shown that the intent of Congress differed from this. Still this would be a bit of a unclear path to a legal victory for the administration as the text of a law usually takes priority over its intent. Additionally even the intent is unclear. It is <a href="http://www.californiahealthline.org/road-to-reform/2013/could-this-little-watched-court-case-sink-obamacare">entirely possible that</a> Congress (or at least some of its members) could have intended to limit the subsidy to the participating states in order to prod states to participate. It seems that the merits of this challenge to the implementation of the ACA is strong, and the case has a substantial chance of success.</p><p>Below is the text of the relavent portion of the law (with emphasis added)  </p><blockquote>
<p>The premium assistance amount determined under this subsection with respect to any coverage month is the amount equal to the lesser of—  <br />(A) the monthly premiums for such month for 1 or more qualified health plans offered in the individual market within a State which cover the taxpayer, the taxpayer's spouse, or any dependent (as defined in section 152) of the taxpayer <strong><em>and which were enrolled in through an Exchange established by the State under 1311 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act,</em></strong> or<br />(B) the excess (if any) of<br />(i) the adjusted monthly premium for such month for the applicable second lowest cost silver plan with respect to the taxpayer, over<br />(ii) an amount equal to 1/12 of the product of the applicable percentage and the taxpayer's household income for the taxable year.</p>

            </p>
            
<p>Yesterday the U.S Supreme Court announced its decision in <em>Burwell v. Hobby Lobby</em>. The Court ruled that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) mandates that Hobby Lobby and other companies with owners that have religious objections to the federal contraceptive mandate be given an exemption to the mandate. The RFRA is a statute passed in 1993 that requires religious exemptions to a wide range of laws and was passed due to Congressional frustration at the courts' unwillingness to mandate exemptions to neutral laws under the First Amendment. The range of the protections for religious objection provided by RFRA are much broader than what the Constitution requires. The RFRA can be repealed or amended like any other law, and due to the Court's ruling in <em>City of Boerne v. Flores</em> (1997) it only applies to federal regulations, not state laws. A Democratic controlled Congress, and Bill Clinton passed the RFRA despite court rulings that stated that applying such a standard would open a floodgate of litigation and requests for exemptions. In <em>Employment Division v. Smith</em> (1990) the Court rejected the standard eventually imposed by the RFRA saying it would effect laws that include "payment of taxes to health and safety regulation such as manslaughter and child neglect laws, compulsory vaccination laws, drug laws, and traffic laws; to social welfare legislation such as minimum wage laws, child labor laws, animal cruelty laws, environmental protection laws, and laws providing for equality of opportunity for the races" . For reasons I will discuss later I think that the majority opinion is the correct interpretation of the RFRA and of current law. The problems with this ruling are mostly the fault of Congress.  However, I also think that the RFRA should be repealed and I am largely opposed to grants of religious exemptions to neutral laws. I will discuss that problem in a future blog post.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Historically, the Supreme Court has long ruled that while religious exemptions can be added to laws, there is no obligation under the First Amendment to grant such exemptions. The First Amendment requires that members of different religions be allowed to communicate their beliefs, requires that the government refrains from favoring certain religious beliefs, and protects the freedom of believers to associate with others who share their beliefs. However, the religious still have to abide by the same laws as everyone else. The first case where the court found this is in <em>Reynolds v. United States</em> (1878) which upheld a law banning polygamy against a religious freedom based challenge.  It is worth noting that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/15/us/a-utah-law-prohibiting-polygamy-is-weakened.html">a 2013 case before the United States District Court in Utah struck down</a> the same polygamy ban statute on privacy grounds. <em>Reynolds</em> created a solid boundary between belief and action. While it is acceptable for one to have and express a religion, it is not as acceptable to put this belief into action, when that action conflicts with the law. That principle was the law until the Supreme Court broadened its interpretation of the Free Exercise clause to allow for more religious exemption to laws. In <em>Sherbert v. Verner</em> (1963) the court found that it violated the First Amendment when the plaintiff in the case was deprived of unemployment benefits as a result of refusing to accept a job that required work on the Sabbath. In <em>Wisconsin v. Yoder</em> (1972) the Court ruled that Amish parents and children must be exempted from truancy laws when those laws mandate attendance to a school that conflicts with Amish belief. In these cases the court ruled that when someone has <span style="color: #252525;">a sincere religious belief that conflicts with a law and when complying with the law would put a substantial burden on the objector's ability to act on that belief, the government has a strong obligation to grant exemptions to the law. The only times when a exemption does not have to be granted occur when the government has a compelling interest that cannot be fulfilled by lesser means. </span> These rulings soon provoked further litigation that eventually drove the Supreme Court to reconsider its stance on this subject matter. In Employment Division v. Smith (1990) the court finally reversed itself and returned to the policy that religious exemptions are not required. In the majority opinion justice Scalia wrote</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The "compelling government interest" requirement seems benign, because it is familiar from other fields. But using it as the standard that must be met before the government may accord different treatment on the basis of race, see, e.g., Palmore v. Sidoti, or before the government may regulate the content of speech, see, e.g., Sable Communications of California v. FCC, is not remotely comparable to using it for the purpose asserted here. What it produces in those other fields -- equality of treatment, and an unrestricted flow of contending speech -- are constitutional norms; what it would produce here -- a private right to ignore generally applicable laws -- is a constitutional anomaly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later in the opinion he said</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The rule respondents favor would open the prospect of constitutionally required religious exemptions from civic obligations of almost every conceivable kind -- ranging from compulsory military service to the payment of taxes to health and safety regulation such as manslaughter and child neglect laws, compulsory vaccination laws, drug laws, and traffic laws; to social welfare legislation such as minimum wage laws, child labor laws, animal cruelty laws, environmental protection laws, and laws providing for equality of opportunity for the races</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, Congress didn't see the problem and passed the RFRA three years later, finding that "<span style="color: #000000;">laws 'neutral' toward religion may burden religious exercise as surely as laws intended to interfere with religious exercise"</span>. The full text of the RFRA can be found at <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130611205052/%3Ca%20href=" http:>http:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>religiousfreedom.lib.virginia.edu/<wbr></wbr>sacred/<wbr></wbr>RFRA1993.html</a>"&gt;<a href="http://religiousfreedom.lib.virginia.edu/sacred/RFRA1993.html">http:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>religiousfreedom.lib.virginia.edu/<wbr></wbr>sacred/<wbr></wbr>RFRA1993.html</a> The core of the law states that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(a) In General: Government shall not substantially burden a person's exercise of religion even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability, except as provided in subsection (b). (b) Exception: Government may substantially burden a person's exercise of religion only if it demonstrates that application of the burden to the person-- (1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest..</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even the application of the word "person" to a corporation such as Hobby Lobby isn't something the Court just came up with. If you object to that <span style="color: #262626;">blame Congress for it.  Even the application of it to corporations is due to the wonderful work of Congress. The Dictionary Act statute at 1 U.S. Code § 1 defines what "person" refers to in legislation in the absence of clarification otherwise, and  the RFRA just said "person" without any clarification otherwise. </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>the words “person” and “whoever” include corporations, companies, associations, firms, partnerships, societies, and joint stock companies, as well as individuals;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, it is worth noting that ultimately the application of religious freedom legislation to a company protects the owners of it. The rights of a company come out of their rights. And the Hobby Lobby company is owned by just a few individuals, all of whom are of uniform opinion on this matter..<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2014/06/30/hobby-lobby-and-the-legal-rights-of-people-organized-as-corporations/"> An editorial in the Washington Post discusses this, and quotes the following passage</a> from Justice Alito's opinion in the Hobby Lobby case.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Congress provided protection for people like the [owners of Hobby Lobby and Conestoga Wood] by employing a familiar legal fiction: It included corporations within RFRA’s definition of “persons.” But it is important to keep in mind that the purpose of this fiction is to provide protection for human beings. A corporation is simply a form of organization used by human beings to achieve desired ends. An established body of law specifies the rights and obligations of the people(including shareholders, officers, and employees) who are associated with a corporation in one way or another. When rights, whether constitutional or statutory, are extended to corporations, the purpose is to protect the rights of these people. For example, extending Fourth Amendment protection to corporations protects the privacy interests of employees and others associated with the company. Protecting corporations from government seizure of their property without just compensation protects all those who have a stake in the corporations’ financial well-being. And protecting the free-exercise rights of corporations like Hobby Lobby, Conestoga, and Mardel protects the religious liberty of the humans who own and control those companies….</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now that it has been established that a firm like Hobby Lobby can claim religious freedom rights under the RFRA, now lets see why the RFRA mandates religious exemptions to the mandate. To win the case Hobby Lobby at the least has to prove two things.</p>
<ol><li>That its owners have a sincere religious belief that conflicts with the mandate. A<span style="color: #262626;">ll that has to be proven is that Hobby Lobby's owners' belief is sincerely held. They don't have to prove that their belief is actually correct.</span></li>
    <li>They have to prove that their ability to exercise  their beliefs are substantially burdened by their beliefs</li>
</ol>
<p>In regards to the first question, the owners of Hobby Lobby claim to believe that using certain forms of contraceptives, or even being complicit in their distribution is immoral. The trial court found no reason to doubt their sincerity in this belief. Much press coverage has though it is absurd that such a indirect connection to the allegedly immoral activity as buying an insurance plan that could be used to acquire contraception, can be the foundation of a RFRA claim. <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2014/06/30/the-religious-freedom-restoration-act-and-complicity-in-sin/">However, the RFRA clearly allows such a claim.</a> As per the terms of that legislation, all that matters is that the owners of Hobby Lobby believe that the law compels them to do an immoral action. If they believe that contributing to someone else's activity is itself immoral, than that is still sufficient.  The conditions for a substantial burden to occur and similarly broad. All that needs to be met is that the owners of the company think that the law compels them to do something that is intolerably sinful.</p>

<p>At this point the government could still salvage its case if it could prove the following two things</p>
<ol><li>There is a compelling government interest involved</li>
    <li>The regulation is the least intrusive legislation possible to meet the interest.</li>
</ol>
<p>The court found that there is a compelling government interest involved. However, there are regulations possible that put less of a burden on the beliefs of the Hobby Lobby owners. The government could for example pay for the contraceptives out of pocket.</p>

            <p>A study published in February looked into the effect that climate change has on temperature-related deaths in the United Kingdom. It found a great possibility for future harm. This risk is focused on vulnerable populations, such as the elderly. The death rates by these causes could increase by thousands per year. The current number of heat-related deaths in the UK is around 2000 per year. By 2050 this could increase to about 7000, and by the turn of the century could reach about 12,000. The authors also project a substintial reduction in cold related deaths, from about 41,000 per year currently, to about 36,000 by the end of the century. However, this reduction will not be enough to offset the increase in heat related deaths, and a net increase of temperature caused deaths of about 5000 per year can be expected by 2100.</p><p>Their modeling was based on the historical relationship between temperature and heat-related deaths. The authors projected the future climate with the IPCC A1B scenario. The A1B is based around an intermediate projection of CO2 emissions. This projection assumes that the rapidly growing global economy will choose a mix of fossil fuels and clean energy sources, and that global population will stabilize at around 9 billion.</p><p>The direct, heatstroke related deaths caused by unchecked climate change could cost tens of thousands of lives. However, these costs are just the tip of the iceberg, and climate change has the potential to be much more destructive than just the risks discussed in this study.</p><p><a href="old.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#old</a> <a href="old.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#old</a> <a href="uk.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#uk</a> <a href="uncategorized.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#uncategorized</a> <a href="unitedkingdom.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#unitedkingdom</a></p></div>                    </div>

<p> It looks like Nate Silver has turned Five-Thirty-Eight into a  generic news website ,and, in the process of this conversion is killing killing what made the old Five-Thirty-Eight website so popular. Or at least Nate Silver has ventured out of the areas that he is skilled at (ie. forcasting elections), and venturing into the world of making a fool of himself (although it does seem that the problem articles are largely ones written by others).</p>

<p>It also looks like Nate Silver is going for that whole be shocking, even at the expense of the facts thing. Look at his climate change coverage:</p>

<p>Think Progress: "<a href="http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2014/03/19/3416369/538-climate-article/">First Climate Article On Nate Silver’s Data Website Uses ‘Deeply Misleading’ Data, Top Climatologists Say</a>"</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>One of the first articles on Nate Silver’s highly anticipated data-driven news site used flawed data to make its conclusions, according to some of the nation’s top climate scientists. Silver’s FiveThirtyEight published its first article about climate change on Wednesday, entitled “Disasters Cost More Than Ever — But Not Because of Climate Change.” But climate scientists are condemning the article and its author, Roger Pielke Jr., saying he ignored critical data to produce a “deeply misleading” result.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ooh.. SHOCKING result! Climate change isn't increasing the cost of disasters! However, there is a big asterisk on that story, as you will find out if you read the Think Progress article.</p>

<p>The Five-Thirty-Eight  economics coverage also seems to have some flaws, and <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/18/sergeant-friday-was-not-a-fox/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;module=BlogPost-Title&amp;version=Blog%20Main&amp;contentCollection=Opinion&amp;action=Click&amp;pgtype=Blogs&amp;region=Body&amp;_r=0">Krugman has written a take down</a>.</p>

            </h2>
                    <p class="reading">
                <span class="vague">9 min read </span>
            </p>
            <p>Earlier this month the European Court of Justice reached a verdict in the case <em>Google Inc v. Mario Costeja González, </em>and found that search engines have an obligation to remove search results about an person in some cases when the results are "linked to his name by a list of results displayed following a search made on the basis of his name", and "causes prejudice to the data subject". That is companies, such as the respondent Google, may have to allow people to curate the results that appear when they are googled. However, many media reports including some media sources in both Europe and in America have missed many critical factors in this ruling.  While this ruling has the potential to cause quite a bit of damage and brings with it very severe censorship risks, its potential impact has been overstated by many sources. In this post,  I will give an overview of this ruling, a discussion of its potential impacts and a background of European privacy law. Before I start I want to note two very fundamental differences between European law and United States law, 1) In the EU legal precedent does not form binding law and EU courts are not bound to follow their past rulings like American courts and European statutes have ultimate primacy , 2) while U.S privacy law largely focuses on protection from government intrusion, in the E.U privacy protections also strongly apply to private actors.</p><p>The text of the opinion (translated from Spanish) can be found at the following link.</p><p><a href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf%3Bjsessionid=9ea7d0f130d57c95e8e65fc04b72a024d865f42c61cf.e34KaxiLc3eQc40LaxqMbN4OaNmNe0?text=&amp;docid=152065&amp;pageIndex=0&amp;doclang=EN&amp;mode=req&amp;dir=&amp;occ=first&amp;part=1&amp;cid=277844"></a><a href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf%3Bjsessionid=9ea7d0f130d57c95e8e65fc04b72a024d865f42c61cf.e34KaxiLc3eQc40LaxqMbN4OaNmNe0?text=&amp;docid=152065&amp;pageIndex=0&amp;doclang=EN&amp;mode=req&amp;dir=&amp;occ=first&amp;part=1&amp;cid=277844">http:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>curia.europa.eu/<wbr></wbr>juris/<wbr></wbr>document/<wbr></wbr>document.jsf;jsessionid=9ea7d0f130d57c95e8e65fc04b72a024d865f42c61cf.e34KaxiLc3eQc40LaxqMbN4OaNmNe0?text=&docid=152065&pageIndex=0&doclang=EN&mode=req&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=277844</a></p><p><strong>Europe's Top Court?</strong></p><p>A lot of media sources covering the case have called the European Court of Justice Europe's highest court. While this is reasonable, it is also a bit of an oversimplification. Europe really has two supreme courts. The European Court of Justice (ECJ), and the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR). Even though the <em>González</em> case came before the ECJ  both courts touch on privacy issues, and understanding the history of both is critical to grasping EU privacy law. And even though they are co-equal courts with no clear way to resolve any conflict that may arise between them, the two courts rarely contradict each other.The ECJ handles litigation that comes up under European Union law. These include legislation passed by the European Parliament (some of which was the basis of the <em>González</em> case), and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (also involved in the case).</p><p>The ECtHR is limited to enforcing a single treaty, the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), a treaty which forms the basis of Europe's civil liberties and civil rights law. The treaty and the court are separate from the EU but all members of the European Union are parties to the Convention, and subject to the court's jurisdiction. The convention and the court have also been joined by non-EU states, including Switzerland, Turkey, and Russia. Even though the ECJ does have jurisdiction on many human rights law related issues (such as those brought up ), the ECtHR is usually the hot bed of such litigation.</p><p><strong>Privacy and Free Speech Law in Europe </strong></p><p>To a large degree the González case is about the trade-off between privacy and free speech. As we will see, Google is on the wrong end of this trade off as far as the European courts are concerned. European law is highly protective of privacy but all too willing to throw freedom of speech under the bus. The European privacy law critical to the <em>González</em> case was the Data Protection Directive passed by the European Parliament  (Directive 95/46/EC to be exact).This was passed to enforce the European Convention on Human Rights' privacy protections, and other law protecting privacy.  This law gives European citizens vast powers to control the collection and use of their personal data. In particular the directive provides that</p><p><em>‘1. Member States shall provide that personal data must be:</em></p><p><em>(a) processed fairly and lawfully;</em></p><p><em>(b) collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a way incompatible with those purposes. Further processing of data for historical, statistical or scientific purposes shall not be considered as incompatible provided that Member States provide appropriate safeguards;</em></p><p><em>(c) adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the purposes for which they are collected and/or further processed;</em></p><p><em>(d) accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that data which are inaccurate or incomplete, having regard to the purposes for which they were collected or for which they are further processed, are erased or rectified;</em></p><p><em>(e) kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the data were collected or for which they are further processed. Member States shall lay down appropriate safeguards for personal data stored for longer periods for historical, statistical or scientific use.</em></p><p>Personal data is a broadly defined term</p><p><em>“personal data” shall mean any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (“data subject”); an identifiable person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identification number or to one or more factors specific to his physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural or social identity;</em></p><p>And so is processing of data.</p><p><em>“processing of personal data” (“processing”) shall mean any operation or set of operations which is performed upon personal data, whether or not by automatic means, such as collection, recording, organisation, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, blocking, erasure or destruction;</em></p><p>The "processing" of personal data is highly limited, and with some exceptions only allowed in cases where " <em>processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by the third party or parties to whom the data are disclosed, except where such interests are overridden by the interests [or] fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection under Article 1(1).</em>’</p><p>An important case pushing the limits of these protections came with the <a href="http://www.ippt.eu/files/2003/IPPT20031106_ECJ_Lindqvist.pdf" target="_blank"><em>Linqvist</em> case</a> (2003), where the ECJ found that the posting of an announcement that a church volunteer was ill on a church website violated the law -- and that the directive is consistent with free speech protections. As that case illustrates, the privacy protections provided by EU law are vast. The privacy rights found in other areas of EU law are similarly broad.  However, free speech protections in Europe are not.  While there are a few highlights in this law, such as <em>Lingens v. Austria</em> (1986) a case before the ECtHR which limited libel suits against journalists when they are criticizing politicians, and<em> Kokkinakis v. Greece</em> (1993) which protected the rights of Jehova's Witnesses to proselytize --  EU free speech law is generally vastly more limited than its American equivalents. Member states are given vast power to limit free speech when deemed in the public interest, and other interests are usually given priority over free speech. There is almost nothing like the First Amendment's almost unconditional prohibition of government censorship.</p><p><strong>The González Case </strong></p><p><em> Google Inc v. Mario Costeja González</em> started when González was upset that a record of the foreclosure of his home was the first result when his name was googled. He claimed that by placing this information in   their search results, and by allowing it to become the first result when his name was searched  Google was storing, publishing  and processing his personal information. As per the Data Protection Directive he wanted the right to have this data removed and filed a complaint against  Google and La Vanguardia, a newspaper publishing an article on the foreclosure, with a regulatory body.  The regulator did not find the newspaper in violation, but did find Google in violation. The case made its way to Spain's second highest court , the Audiencia Nacional, which then referred it to the ECJ. The ECJ agreed that Google was in violation and sated that the company has an obligation to remove personal information from search results in some cases. FIrst of all the information had to be "inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant", "linked to his name by a list of results displayed following a search made on the basis of his name", and of a nature that "causes prejudice to the data subject". Already multiple other individuals have filed requests from removal of information from search results. <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-27439194" target="_blank">According to the BBC</a> these include</p><p><em>A man who tried to kill members of his own family who has asked for links to a news article to be taken down <br />
A celebrity's child who wanted links to news articles about a criminal conviction removed <br />
A suspended university lecturer who asked for the removal of links to articles mentioning the disciplinary action <br />
A convicted cyberstalker who, after being cited in an article about cyberstalking law, wants links to it taken down <br />
An actor who has asked for links to articles about an affair he had with a teenager taken down <br />
A man convicted of running a tax scam who wants all links referencing the event removed</em></p><p>Due to the limited nature of the ruling, many of these requests can be expected to be rejected, as, these are less likely to meet the  "inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant" standard.</p><p>Cross-posted On Medium</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@theojones/df2fc36e9e58"></a><a href="https://medium.com/@theojones/df2fc36e9e58">https:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>medium.com/<wbr></wbr>@theojones/<wbr></wbr>df2fc36e9e58</a></p><p><a href="ecj.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#ecj</a> <a href="europetopcourt.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#europetopcourt</a> <a href="europeanunion.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#europeanunion</a> <a href="memberstates.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#memberstates</a> <a href="old.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#old</a> <a href="old.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#old</a> <a href="uncategorized.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#uncategorized</a></p></div>                    </div>

<p>In this post I will demonstrate four things 1) labor markets are subject to fundamentally the same pressures and limitations as other markets, 2) There is strong theoretical and observational evidence from research in economics that a higher minimum wage will result in a higher unemployment rate during a healthy economy, 3) that this change will have an adverse impact on many of the workers that minimum wage policies are written to help, and 4) that it is possible and necessary to create programs that help the poor without these adverse impacts of minimum wages. The first point is important as it weakens arguments that hinge on whether workers are earning a income that they can live on. I am not saying that it is irrelevant if workers are living in poverty or not, just that policy should be evaluated in terms of the real-world economic impact of the lives of these workers. How the economically optimal wage makes you feel is irrelevant. If minimum wage policies are not having the desired impact, then you may want to reconsider other policy options. The second point is the core of my argument in this post. Basic economic theory suggests that increases in the minimum wage increase the unemployment rate when the economy is near full employment. When the economy is far from full employment, however, there may be a temporary decrease in unemployment due to the consumer demand created by the wage increases, but at full employment that extra demand will just go into inflation. The third point is the corollary of the second point. The individuals facing the increased risk of unemployment will be many of the adult, poor, individuals that need help the most. The fourth point is key. Getting rid of poverty is something that needs to be done. However, we don’t need minimum wages to alleviate poverty, and they have been quite ineffective at it. I will propose two measures that will do a better job at eliminating poverty. In particular I will argue for a basic income policy that will give all adult citizens an unconditional payment that would be sufficient to take them out of poverty. I also believe that a nation wide jobs program — possibly one similar to the Great Depression era Works Progress Administration, but also possibly one created by subsidising private employers — should be created with the task of guaranteeing a job at a reasonable wage to all willing and able to work. This type of jobs program would serve a similar role to a minimum wage, but it would not increase unemployment because the workers that would wind up unemployed under a higher minimum wage would instead wind up on the government payroll. The combination of the two programs would serve to eliminate poverty, and would give all individuals a chance to earn a good income.I will close the post by discussing why minimum wages are popular, despite the lack of evidence of their effectiveness.</p>

<p>Labor is Just Another Market <br />All throughout the political discourse, you will see the opinion that wages and labor are separate from the pressures that affect all other things in the economy. In a normal market prices are subject to the usual situation of supply and demand. And the prices fluctuate according to how many people want to supply a good, and how many people want to buy the good. However, many, such as the author of a front page article on Daily Kos don’t think this happens with labor markets.</p>

<p>I guess how Don Thompson [the McDonald’s CEO]tries to be a really great employer is to pay his workers so little that they get an estimated $1.2 billion in public assistance. And by providing workers with budget advice suggesting they get a second job and don’t spend anything on heat. And by offering an employee “McResources” helpline that told a worker with 10 years of experience at McDonald’s to apply for food stamps. Plus, for all Thompson’s talk of opportunity, there are few opportunities for advancement in the fast food industry, which has a low percentage of managerial jobs and pays its first-line supervisors a median of just $13.06. <br />The only way this is competitive is if the competition is to keep workers poor. <br />Lets unpack this a bit.Heres one thing that neither conservatives or liberals will tell you about wages — but that economic theory does. It doesn't matter how hard someone works, or how valuable their work is to the world, or how much the person needs the money, or how great and upstanding the worker is. The only thing your wage depends on is how many people are willing to do the job you do, and how many people want to buy what you make. The employees at McD’s probably work hard and need the money — but in the end a lot of people can do what they do. Therefore, their wages are bound to be low. Same with the likes of immigrant farm workers. Hard work, would’nt want to do it. But lots of people have that skillset. So, wages are going to be low. Lets look at a highly paid market. Say, computer programmers. You will hear some in the tech industry wax poetic about how hard startup founders work. Not really. If you think that, just talk to some of those farm workers. However, the thing is, there are relatively few people with the skillset needed for the tech industry, when compared to the number of people who want to consume tech products (and if you doubt that “consume” is the right word, just try working on tech support for some really dumb lusers — they consume their computers pretty rapidly). Supply and demand applies everywhere, and is a callous bastard that doesn't care about how much you need money or if not having it will push you on welfare. But we keep markets around because they are so efficient — or at least more efficient that the alternatives. And to an extent, supply and demand provides that for some people wages will never be able to reach a level where they can meet their needs just by the income they earn. So, maybe a better alternative to the McD way of “ providing workers with budget advice suggesting they get a second job and don't spend anything on heat”, would be to expand government antipoverty programs, so that they have enough money to afford heat without a second job. The often heard claim that welfare programs subsidize low wage employers is a bit dubious on economic grounds, but that is another blog post.</p>

<p>Supply and demand isn't the only market force that also applies to labor. A business will only hire someone if it sees a profit from that action. But at some point there is only a certain amount of income that a worker can generate for a business. If the wages required to hire a worker exceed the level where it is profitable to hire then the worker won’t be hired. Oh. And there are substitutes to hiring workers. A lot of low-wage workers in retail can be substituted by computer kiosks — if it becomes profitable to make the substitution. Labor markets cannot avoid being exposed to the forces that other markets are, but a lot of arguments for the minimum wage require suspending disbelief on this matter. Later I will show that these market forces mean that minimum wage policies will be counter productive.</p>

<p>The Theoretical Argument For Why Minimum Wages Increase Unemployment</p>

<p>The core of the argument for why minimum wages increase unemployment comes from the basics of supply and demand. Supply and demand can be easily modeled. There is a rule that can model the effect that price has on the demand for a product called the law of demand. It states that the demand for a product should tend to decline as its price goes up. Similarly, the level of a product supplied in a market can be modeled by the law of supply, which states that a higher price means a greater supply of products in a market.</p>

<p>The law of demand is pretty damming for the minimum wage. It means that, when everything else is equal, an increase in the wage will mean less demand for the labor of workers. This loss of demand for labor means a increase in unemployment. And it is the law of demand that incorporates the previously made observation that if the wages required to hire a worker exceed the level where it is profitable to hire then the worker won’t be hired into economic models. Because the productivity of workers is at the core of how the workers will be affected, the least skilled workers will be the ones hit the worst. The law of supply also creates problems for the minimum wage. The increased price that labor can fetch can be expected to increase the number of people who want jobs. In fact we can say that in general a price control that sets a minimum price for a good creates a surplus of the good, while a price ceiling creates a shortage of the good. This simple model does break down when the economy is depressed, as during a depressed economy the increased consumer demand due to the wage increase can reduce unemployment. However, this consumer demand increase has little to no effect in a healthy economy. This is because wages are spent on a wide range of industries and how workers spend their wages is rarely targeted towards the industries where there is the most unemployment.</p>

<p>However, this theoretical discussion is not entirely conclusive. Many have argued that due to the vastly asymmetrical bargaining power between workers, the effect of a minimum wage is primarily to even out this difference. Other effects that alleviate the negative impact of minimum wage policies on unemployment have been proposed. The only way to conclusively rule these out is through empirical study. Which brings us to my next section.</p>

<p>The Empirical Evidence</p>

<p>The minimum wage debate has been one of the most widely studied issues in economics, and a glut of research has been produced to resolve the debate. Most of this empirical data is favorable to the conclusion that increases in the minimum wage increase unemployment. In discussing this research I will take a broad view of the research in this area, focusing on that the broad opinion of the research community, rather than a few specific studies. With science of all fields, including economics, reproducibility is key. You know a result is good, not when one team has come up with a given result, but when many separate teams come to a result. There is another reason why it is dangerous to over rely on a single study; there is error in data collection and it is possible to come to an erroneous result just by bad luck. Also bias and poor study design can also make a study come out to a wrong result. Therefore, it is necessary to take into account the design of the studies, and to make sure that the authors are really measuring what they think they are measuring. For the previously mentioned reasons we can create a hierarchy of research quality. At the top is a well done research review. A research review is a study that compiles results from other researchers and seeks out the general trends in this research. The next rung is the controlled study — something that is effectively impossible to do in researching the minimum wage. The third rung is the observational study. These are studies that attempt to systematically observe the impacts of a change in multiple distinct locations and that use statistical methods to analyse the observations. The lowest rung consists of non-systematic observations and case studies. These provide very weak evidence, but unfortunately have a large role in public dialogue. For these reasons I will primarily look at literature reviews.</p>

<p>David Neumark and William Wascher conducted a literature review of the topic in 2006, focusing on recent (at the time) research. They found that the studies conducted tend to indicate that the minimum wage increases unemployment. In their words “A sizable majority of the studies surveyed in this monograph give a relatively consistent (although not always statistically significant) indication of negative employment effects of minimum wages … we see very few — if any — studies that provide convincing evidence of positive employment effects of minimum wages”. Additionally, they found that the studies that show that a minimum wage increase does not increase unemployment often have methodological flaws that reduce their credibility. When these flawed studies are filtered out, “among the papers we view as providing the most credible evidence, almost all point to negative employment effects”. The authors then looked at the question of who is harmed by minimum wage increases and found that “the studies that focus on the least-skilled groups provide relatively overwhelming evidence of stronger disemployment effects for these groups.” This paper also contains a discussion of the history of the research and discussion of the issue that is worth a read. It is worth noting that Neumark and Wascher conducted a previous observational study where they found that minimum wage increases depressed employment by a substantial margin.</p>

<p>A literature review by Charles Brown, Curtis Gilroy, and Andrew Kohen looked at the effect of minimum wage changes on youth unemployment. They give an overview of the theoretical models of the issue and then they look at studies of the empirical evidence. They found that most studies suggest small increases in unemployment in response to an increase in the minimum wage, and substantial numbers of youth will drop out of the labor force all together. The data is ambiguous on the issue of whether whites or minorities will be affected more.</p>

<p>How to Fight Poverty Without the Minimum Wage</p>

<p>Despite my opinions about the minimum wage I still believe that it is necessary to fight poverty. There is sufficient wealth in the United States to eliminate poverty. We have taken the path of inaction when all Western European and Scandinavian nations have for decades tried to eliminate and alleviate the suffering of the poor. They have made great strides in doing so, while still keeping strong economies. But the U.S. has stood still, letting poverty deprive millions of access to basic rights such as food, shelter, health care, and a chance for a productive life.</p>

<p>It is possible to fight poverty without the possible negative impacts of minimum wage policies. To fix poverty in the U.S , I would recommend a basic income program. Every family would receive a sum of money from the federal government to make their income above the poverty line level. Because everyone would get to keep the income they earned by working, without effecting the lump sum paid to them, someone is always better off working. Also an income level just barely above the poverty line isn't enough to take away someone’s motivation to work, since isn’t very much money and wouldn’t provide for many or any extras or luxuries. To help people earn more than this basic income government jobs program, and/or wage subsidies should be enacted.</p>

<p>I've been thinking about what the best interface for a social networking program would be. <a title="What Would the Ideal Distributed Social Networking Application Look Like?" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140403093812/%3Ca%20href=" https:>https:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>theojones.name/<wbr></wbr>index.php/<wbr></wbr>2013/<wbr></wbr>12/<wbr></wbr>30/<wbr></wbr>ideal-distributed-social-networking-application-look-like/<wbr></wbr></a>"&gt;As I noted in a post a while ago about social networks.</p>

<p>A good social network should be easy to use. It should be easy to use the client for the network and it should be easy to install a server for the network. But by easy to use I mean <a href="http://www.over-yonder.net/~fullermd/rants/userfriendly/2" rel="follow"><strong>easy to learn</strong>, not easy to use without learning</a>. Easy to use without learning is the unfortunate interface design methodology employed by many businesses, including Facebook. However, it can most clearly be found in Apple’s products and to a lesser extent in Microsoft’s.</p>

<p>Computers are complex devices and the easy to use without learning design methodology tries to hide this complexity from the user. This design methodology can only exist by limiting flexibility and by taking away possibilities. This design attempts to create smart computers, but dumb users. However, the easy to use without learning design hurts users in the long run. It kills the flexibility of a system, it creates software that second guesses the user at every point and this design discourages user learning, churning out “computer illiterate” users. A program can only be easy to use without learning if it is simplified enough that many of the most powerful features of the system are reduced.  It also adds to software complexity and bloat. The easy to learn design methodology admits that computers are complex. Users are expected to know a bit about how the system works and why they are doing what they are doing. This design allows simple flexible systems which cover many use cases.</p>

<p>What UI design is best able to create a social networking system that is easy to learn, without nerfing the system into a easy to use without learning design. Oddly enough, I have come to the conclusion that it  may be the command line. CLIs are not dead interfaces and have many benefits over GUIs for many applications. They require the user to learn more to use , but are much more powerful. I will discuss these general benefits, and then go into some specifics about what a command line for a social networking program would work, and how such an interface could be integrated into a social networking system.</p>

<p><!--more-->Command line interfaces are not dead. The Linux operating system still makes heavy use of them (in fact my laptop does not have a full desktop environment or GUI file manager installed, instead I use a mix of a tiling window manager and terminal applications). Command lines are a core interface of this operating system, and the Unix philosophy that drives the design of Linux and other modern UNIXes (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy">"<em>This is the Unix philosophy: Write programs that do one thing and do it well. Write programs to work together. Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.")</em></a>. GUIs . CLIs are<a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/WebSitesWithEmbeddedCommandLinesYouGotYourCommandLineInMyInternet.aspx"> becoming increasingly popular on web applications too</a>.</p>

<p>About a month ago I discussed <a title="What Would the Ideal Distributed Social Networking Application Look Like?" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140403093812/%3Ca%20href=" https:>https:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>theojones.name/<wbr></wbr>index.php/<wbr></wbr>2013/<wbr></wbr>12/<wbr></wbr>30/<wbr></wbr>ideal-distributed-social-networking-application-look-like/<wbr></wbr></a>"&gt;the need for a distributed social networking application. At the time I wrote that article there were no social networking systems around that were reasonably easy to install, secure, and with a usable feature set. I just found out about<a href="http://twister.net.co/"> a new application, Twister, that </a>comes close to meeting these goals. Its open source, and it seems to be easy to write software that interfaces with it. It is fully decentralized and its server can run on a regular computer without the need for an always on server.  Its main flaw seems to be that there is no way to to run a web based interface for it from a remote computer. This means that it is currently impossible to have a website that you can just go to and register an account at without installing anything on your computer. However, I have done a bit on coding over the weekend and I think this issue is pretty tractable. I have written an application in Python that can allow users to view Twister profiles over the web and I have , eventually I will post this code, and time permitting I may turn this into a full hosted web based interface for Twister that accounts can be registered at. In the rest of this post I will discuss some of the flaws and possibilities with this network. I will then discuss how to install it on Linux Mint (still not as easy a process as it could be).<br /><!--more--><br />The other clear limitation of Twister is that it has adopted the 140 character  limit from Twi<strong><em>tt</em></strong>er. This limits the depth and nature of the posts that can be made with this system. There are reasons to limit the size of messages, but 140 is too low. A social networking system should allow enough text to put a link with a solid paragraph of text. I reckon this would be about a limit of 1000 characters.</p>

<p>There is also no support for anything like Facebook's groups.This issue seems easy to code around because it would possible to just create a program that manages a page that posts out the content of any private messages sent to it. This program would also need to have the appropriate measures needed to drop the banhammer on the occasional idiot. This program would work in a similar way to GNU Mailman or other email mailing list managers.</p>

<p>The private messaging features in twister are weak. It does not allow anyone who you are not already following to message you, but in any messaging system there are reasons to want the ability to message people that you have not already been in contact with. It is harder to code around this issue, but the use of relays that people can follow may be one way to code around this limitation.It may even be true that private and public messaging is so totally different that it would be better to write separate application to handle each task.</p>

<p>Profiles have very few options.</p>

<p>The loss of a private key means the loss of your profile. There therefore needs to be a way to back up this key. A program that uses Shamir's Secret Sharing or a similar algorithm to split a backup of the key into pieces and then distributes these pieces among the user's friends  may be one easy way to resolve these issues.</p>

<p>I have found that the best way to interface with the Twister RPC is not through the Twister author's suggested python-bitcoin (which is really just a JSON RPC client) ,but instead is through the pyjsonrpc library. Here is some Python code to grab the contents of user profiles and format it into HTML that I wrote with this library: (wordpress doesn't seem to handle the formatting of python code very well, eventually I'll create a GitHub repository for this).</p>

<p>http_client = pyjsonrpc.HttpClient( <br />url = "http://localhost:28332", <br />username = "user", <br />password = "pwd" <br />)</p>

<p>def GetRawProfileJSON(UserNameToLookUp): <br />return http_client.call("dhtget", UserNameToLookUp, "profile", "s") <br />def GetParsedProfileJSON(UserNameToLookUp): <br />return GetRawProfileJSON(UserNameToLookUp)[0]['p']['v']</p>

<p>Installing this program is easier than most other distributed social networking apps but still a pain. Here is how I did it on Linux Mint.</p>

<p>sudo apt-get install git</p>

<p>sudo apt-get install autoconf</p>

<p>sudo apt-get install automake</p>

<p>sudo apt-get install libtool</p>

<p>sudo apt-get install g++</p>

<p>sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev</p>

<p>sudo apt-get install libssl-dev</p>

<p>sudo apt-get install libdb5.3++ libdb5.3++-dev</p>

<p>sudo apt-get install miniupnpc</p>

<p>sudo apt-get install libminiupnpc-dev</p>

<p>sudo apt-get install libglibmm-2.4-dev</p>

<p>git clone <a href="https://github.com/miguelfreitas/twister-core.git"></a><a href="https://github.com/miguelfreitas/twister-core.git">https:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>github.com/<wbr></wbr>miguelfreitas/<wbr></wbr>twister-core.git</a></p>

<p>cd twister-core</p>

<p>./bootstrap.sh</p>

<p>./configure --enable-logging --enable-debug</p>

<p>make</p>

<p>make will take a while</p>

<p>mkdir ~/.twister</p>

<p>cd ~/.twister</p>

<p>git clone <a href="https://github.com/miguelfreitas/twister-html.git"></a><a href="https://github.com/miguelfreitas/twister-html.git">https:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>github.com/<wbr></wbr>miguelfreitas/<wbr></wbr>twister-html.git</a> html</p>
