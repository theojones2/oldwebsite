<p>Last month <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/07/world/asia/japans-parliament-approves-a-secrecy-law-amid-protests.html">Japan's parliament passed a secrecy law</a> which dramatically increases the range of documents that are kept secret in Japan and increases penalties for leaking documents. The law's definition of what constitutes a secret is vague and the law gives government agencies broad latitude in classifying material. The law's broadness and vagueness, and the harsh -- up to 10 years in prison -- penalties that come with it may be used to harass journalists and whistle-blowers.  <br /><!--more--></p>

<p>The patent system is an amazingly inefficient method to fund research. Patents drive up the costs of pharmaceuticals and other products, they increase market concentration, they harm consumers and they misdirect research efforts away from basic research. This inefficiency comes from three sources. The first is that the patent system is fundamentally a monopoly grant. Monopolies by their nature can charge way more than the cost that something takes to produce. This hurts consumers. The second issue is that research funding produces an economic issue that is similar to that faced in funding public goods like parks and roads. There is a large fixed cost in research that has to be paid regardless of whether 1 person uses a product derived from it or 1 million people benefit from the research. The third issue is that the patent system biases research funding towards research that will result in a marketable product in the short term. However, the basic research that will result in the next generation's innovations gets the short shrift in this system. I argue that the patent system should be replaced  <br /><!--more--></p>
<p>The patent system is fundamentally a monopoly grant. It gives the inventor the exclusive right to manufacture the invention (even if it was independently discovered by someone else) and excludes all others. The economic effect of this is simple; prices are driven up. A manufacturer in a competitive market can only charge just above the cost of manufacture -- including the cost of outbidding the alternative uses for the resources needed in production. However, a company in a concentrated market can charge whatever consumers are willing to pay. In many markets -- in particular the pharmaceutical business --  what people will pay for a product and what it takes to bring it into production are very different numbers. Because of this many consumers will not be able to access these products, or at least will be overcharged. The empirical evidence for this can be seen in the vast price differences between generic drugs and similar drugs under patent protection.Generic drugs usually cost between  <a href="http://www.healthsmart.com/SmarterHealth/GenericvsBrandDrugs.aspx">30-80% less than their name brand counterparts</a>.When this cost difference results in patients being unable to access the drugs that they need, the effects can be dire. Furthermore, this system encourages businesses to waste resources on gaining and maintaining patent rights. Patent litigation is expensive and the patent system encourages the formation of patent trolls which abuse this system for their profit. Drug companies spend large amounts of money on creating variants of already existing drugs in order to extend their patent rights - even when there is little added benefit to the copycat drugs. The patent system also encourages an industry of lobbying that only makes the system more inefficient.</p><p>Think of a park. A typical park has a large fixed cost --- a cost that must be paid for anyone to use it. However, once this fixed cost is paid then many people can use the park. In fact, the most efficient way to use the park is to allow as many people as possible to access it, once the fixed cost is paid.  It is for this reason that parks are usually government funded with free access, or at least low-cost admission. Research faces a similar issue. There is a cost to making a discovery, but once its made an unlimited number of people can benefit from it. </p><p>The patent system also encourages a disproportionate focus on research that has has a high chance of resulting in the short term production of a patentable product . This is because a patent only can protect  a particular product or method. There is no way that the patent system can be used to reward basic research that does not result directly in a product. This is a severe flaw because basic research can result in long term benefits for industry and the public. </p><p>The alternative to the patent system is public funding of research. One objection to government funding of research is maintaining its independence, while still allowing the public some say in how the funding is allocated. I will propose a system of government research funding that handles both of these goals well. My proposal focuses on what I will call independent funding organizations. These organizations would be ran independently from the government. A voucher would be made available to every resident of the U.S that could be used to fund these organizations. The organizations would of course be regulated to prevent waste and misuse of funds. But the variety of organizations in existence and their decentralized funding source would limit political interference while still encouraging public accountability.         </p><p><a href="tag/old.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#old</a> <a href="tag/old.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#old</a> <a href="tag/uncategorized.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#uncategorized</a></p></div>                    </div>

<p>As a follow up to <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140326141811/%3Ca%20href=" https:>https:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>theojones.name/<wbr></wbr>index.php/<wbr></wbr>2014/<wbr></wbr>01/<wbr></wbr>05/<wbr></wbr>done-u-s-health-care-system/<wbr></wbr></a>" title="What should be done with the U.S health care system?"&gt;yesterday's blog post, I will discuss why we need a health care system which provides universal coverage. <br />What would you do if one day while you were driving on the highway and you saw a car accident victim lieing on the road injured bleeding to death? Most people would try to help the injured person. Some states even require you to do so. When that person is taken to the hospital the hospital is required to provide treatment regardless of the victim's ability to pay.  However, our current healthcare system is not as compassionate to a cancer patient who can not afford the treatment he needs to live. There are millions of uninsured in this country that might face the same fate as that hypothetical cancer patient. <br />Many of you might be worried about the involvement in the healthcare system by government that guaranteeing healthcare as a human right might entail. While this debate is just about whether healthcare is a human right I will address this issue. Are private insurance companies that are accountable to nothing but their profit margins really any better then an accountable elected government? Under our current system you have life and death decisions being made to maximize profit instead of providing healthcare to all.  </p>

<p><!--more--><br />I will argue that healthcare is a human right. Something can become a human right if it is needed to sustain human freedom and dignity. That is the very definition of a right. Protecting human rights keep society livable for all citizens.   I will argue that in the 21st century healthcare is needed for the the rights of "life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness" that are detailed in the United States Deceleration of Independence  to truly take effect.  <br />Very few of will dispute commonly recognized human rights such as freedom of speech, privacy and the ability to participate in the political system. Why should health care also be in this list? One reason is that it's a right that is necessary to fully utilize the political rights. All the rights that exist on paper mean nothing to a dead person. Having the ability to be alive and healthy is a necessary predecessor to being able to enjoy civil and political rights. <br />  <br />The rationale for healthcare being a human right really all goes back to what's in our Declaration of Independence. The Declaration of Independence guarantees everyone "life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness" In our modern society healthcare is life. No one can easily have equal opportunity in pursuing happiness when they have to worry about how they'll pay for their child's cancer treatment. Human rights are special because of the fact that human rights directly relate to fundamental human needs.</p>

<p> Health care  qualifies as a fundamental human need in the 21st century. If you don't have healthcare you get sick and die. Having a functional body that is not collapsing around you is the first and foremost need of humans. It is the need that we are the most concerned about and it is the need that we seek to fulfill for our selves before we become concerned about such issues as participating in society to make the world a better place.   People without healthcare can not fully participate in the society. The level of poverty that allows people to go without something as fundamental as adequate healthcare undermines human dignity. The suffering of someone who can not get the cancer treatment they need is real and it is an avoidable side effect of our current economic system. <br />Even in a industrialized economy like the U.S many people still die from lack of health care. According to a study by Harvard University that was cited by a 2009 article in Reuters over 45,000 Americans die from lack of health care.the study found that the uninsured aged between 17 an 64 have a 40% higher chance of dyeing then those that have health insurance.  According to the U.S Department of Health and Human Services there are almost 46 million uninsured. There are 46 million people in the wealthiest nation in the world that might die of a preventable cause because we have chosen not to provide healthcare to them. <br />Even children and babies are not immune the the effects of lack of healthcare. According to the United Nations Population Division the United States has a infant mortality rate of 6.3 deaths per 1000 births. Nations with universal healthcare tend to have lower infant mortality rates. For example Norway has a infant mortality rate of 3.3 deaths per 1000 births and Sweden has a infant mortality rate of 3.2 deaths per 1000 births <br />The lack of health care in the United States is an issue that causes millions throughout this country to worry and suffer This problem even causes some people to lose their lives. This is one of the strongest arguments that health care is a human right. In the 21st century with all of the inventions of modern medicine that can extend the average person's life by decades healthcare means life. <br />The role of our government is to provide for the safety and protection of its population and to provide a framework for a system  truly allow everyone to pursue happiness.The preamble to the U.S Constitution gives a good summary of this role of government. It reads </p>
<blockquote>
<p>We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> Healthcare isn't all that distinct from other human rights. All human rights require some degree of legal enforcement to be set up so they can be fully realized by the population. One can not invision a workable system where property rights self enforce but they are still internationality reconised as a right that deserves enforcement. Even the political rights require an independent judiciary to validate that they are indeed being enforced.</p>

<p>The argument that healthcare is a human right is bolstered by such treaties as the universal declaration of human rights , which includes the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and  <br />well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing  <br />and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in  <br />the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other  <br />lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Universal Declaration of Human Rights was written by the United Nations in 1948 and just eight of the U.N member states chose not to approve the treaty.</p>

<p>In the 21st century healthcare is needed for the the rights of "life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness" to truly take effect. In our world with the wonders of modern science and medicine healthcare is life. Thousands in this country die each year because of lack of healthcare. The U.S has an obligation help the right to healthcare be realised at home and abroad. </p>

<p>America should have universal healthcare available to all residents of the country at an affordable price. I believe that the United States healthcare system should be a public insurance system-- one where a government agency is the sole provider of basic health insurance. This basic health coverage should replace Medicare, Medicaid, and the health insurance provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). But some fees should still be charged to patients based on income, ability to pay, and the type of healthcare used. This would prevent overuse of healthcare services. Payments to healthcare providers, such as physicians, should generally be on a fixed salary basis. That is, doctors would be paid a salary, instead of a payment for each appointment or service provided. Additionally, hospital care should be transitioned to a public provider system operated by local governments and funded by the federal government through its insurance system. I also propose a drastic reform of the pharmaceutical industry that includes eliminating patents on drugs and instead funding medical research through government spending, which I will discuss in a follow up post. The role of private insurance companies should be limited to payment for healthcare not covered by the government plan.<br /><!--more--><br />There are two primary goals that I believe a healthcare system should focus on: <br />1. A healthcare system should provide necessary healthcare in an equitable fashion and should limit costs paid by the patients to a level within their ability to pay. This necessary healthcare includes primary care, hospital care, medications, dental care and psychiatric care, as well as nursing home and hospice care. However, currently, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140713035618/%3Ca%20href=" https:>https:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>www.census.gov/<wbr></wbr>newsroom/<wbr></wbr>releases/<wbr></wbr>archives/<wbr></wbr>income_wealth/<wbr></wbr>cb13-165.html</a>"&gt;the American healthcare system does not provide sufficient affordable coverage to all. As of 2012, 48 million Americans lacked health insurance, according to the U.S Census Bureau. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140110020309/%3Ca%20href=" http:>http:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>www.cbo.gov/<wbr></wbr>sites/<wbr></wbr>default/<wbr></wbr>files/<wbr></wbr>cbofiles/<wbr></wbr>attachments/<wbr></wbr>44190_EffectsAffordableCareActHealthInsuranceCoverage_2.pdf</a>"&gt;The implementation of the ACA is expected to reduce this by just 18 million, according to the Congressional Budget Office. This will still leave approximately 30 million without health insurance. The problem of uninsured Americans could be solved by the universal health care system that I'm proposing, which would provide healthcare to all U.S. citizens. <br />2. A healthcare system should promote maximally efficient and cost- effective use of healthcare resources while maintaining quality of care. When consistent with the other goals, individuals should pay some of the the costs of the healthcare services they use consistent with their income and ability to pay. This is necessary to discourage overconsumption of healthcare services and to discourage people from taking actions that increase their risk of health problems. These actions may include some risky activities such as smoking. <br />Neither goal is achieved by the current health care system. Patients are encouraged to over consume health care services because a third party, such as an insurer, often ends up paying the bill. This overconsumption of healthcare can be the result of patient demands for unneeded medical services made without consideration of the cost of the treatment. Healthcare providers are encouraged to over supply healthcare because the fee-for-service payment method used by most of the American healthcare system rewards healthcare providers for each service provided and because consumers of healthcare services have little knowledge of the nature of the care or services provided to them. A healthcare system with a single public health payer, which reimburses providers on a fixed-rate basis, but charges patients fees based on their healthcare use (if they are able to pay), will best be able to create incentives that minimize overconsumption. While any system that provides universal coverage will face overconsumption issues, a system that has patients pay for a portion of their healthcare usage commensurate with their ability to pay will minimize these issues. Fees can serve as a reminder to the patient that there are costs for healthcare services and can act as an incentive to take these costs into account. <br />Fees charged to the patients as part of this system should go into a general healthcare fund, not to the provider. This system would create the positive incentives found in both fee-for-service systems and in fixed-rate systems. I believe this  proposed system would reduce healthcare overconsumption issues because in the current healthcare system insurance plans generally cover a large portion of health expenses, even if the patient can afford to pay more out of pocket. <br />A core way of achieving the goals of providing necessary healthcare in an equitable, as well as in an efficient and cost-effective manner, while maintaining quality care, is through a government insurer with universal, tax-funded coverage. <br />Goal one, providing necessary healthcare in an equitable fashion, would be met because under my proposed public health insurance system, healthcare would be provided to all  with costs commensurate with a patient's ability to pay, The public insurance plan would, however, include co-pays, deductibles, and other fees set based on ability to pay and the nature of the health care provided. These would exist to discourage overuse of health care, discourage use of inferior or more expensive health care options, and to internalize as much of the burden of actions that increase the risk of higher health expenditures. Wealthy individuals would receive much more limited government paid coverage.  I propose that this should be done through attaching a deductible to the government provided basic plan that would be set based on a percentage of the patient's income minus the poverty limit. Those with incomes equal to, or less than, the poverty line will face no deductible. However, those with higher incomes will face gradually higher deductibles. This basic government plan can be supplemented by private insurance and savings. Co-pays could be assessed on treatment methods that are known to have more effective or less expensive alternatives. <br />Goal two, promoting efficiency and cost-effectiveness would be met in three ways. First, under my proposal, with the entire nation on the same healthcare system, there would be economies of scale. A public payer will serve almost all of the patients in the market and, therefore, be able to maximize these economies of scale. With so many private and nonprofit entities providing services in our current healthcare system, there is much redundancy in administrative costs. The administrative costs of an insurer most strongly correlates with its size, as there are many fixed costs in the U.S insurance market. <br />Therefore, it can be expected that public payer administrative costs would be less. For example, the administrative costs of private insurance companies is on average about 14 percent of total expenditures. However, Medicare has administrative costs of about four percent. <br />A second way that the proposed system would be more cost-effective is that a public payer would have have strong bargaining power with health care providers and would be able to negotiate prices downward. This is because almost all health care purchases will be conducted through this payer and any firm that does not negotiate with it will have a strongly limited market share. The potential benefits of this are very high. <br />The third way a public payer would be more efficient is that it would have the ability to significantly influence healthcare and promote cost-effective techniques and methodologies by using its negotiating power. <br />I believe that hospital care in the United States should gradually be transitioned to a public system operated by local governments. Health care provision has multiple issues that make public provision a possibly more efficient option. First of all, hospital markets are very concentrated and have limited competition. A 2011 study found,  that by the Federal Trade Commission's definition, most hospital markets are highly, or very highly, concentrated (Robinson).  In a choice between a private monopolistic market and a public monopoly, the public monopoly will be more accountable to consumers because government officials have to face elections, while the owners of a private monopoly are motivated mostly by profitability.  Also, consumers often lack the knowledge to fully understand the comparative value of the various healthcare options available, so in any market there are many opportunities to profit from this lack of knowledge. Just as there are many economies of scale on the payment side of the healthcare industry, there are many ways that a public provider can become more efficient due to being the main provider in an area.</p>

<p>Current centralized social networking websites, such as Facebook have many flaws.They have persistent privacy issues and breaches. Their moderation policies are often problematic and applied arbitrarily. These systems are vulnerable to censorship and government manipulation.</p>

<p>The risks of this to privacy are shown by the NSA leaks. The risks to free speech are shown by how, <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2238519/Facebook-bans-picture-woman-reclining-bathtub--shows-elbow.html">when under pressure from the Turkish government Facebook restricted posts advocating Kurdish independence</a> and "Any attack on Ataturk [Turkey's first president]". With a centralized structure these issues of government interference are almost unavoidable. The nature of these networks also means that there is little ability for the user to modify and customize the interface because all of the code runs on the server, and because this code is not open source. This is part of the reason why Facebook has to roll out interface changes to all users, often with many dissatisfied users. Some projects have tried to improve the Facebook interface by running client-side software that modifies the HTML and JavaScript produced by Facebook, <a href="http://socialfixer.com/blog/2013/12/18/social-fixer-is-partly-broken-heres-why/">but this method is error prone</a>.A distributed social network built around a single protocol that allows different implementations of the system, running on different servers would fix these issues. This network would be like email. You can run your own mail server (like I do) and different mail servers can communicate with each other.You can choose from different email providers. A decentralized social network would lessen all of the issues I discussed. If individuals run their own servers, governments would have a hard time controlling these servers. A decentralized system would allow many different implementations and configurations of the system to run. The users would be allowed to choose from the configuration that best suits their wants. They would also be able to chose from different hosts of the system. In the rest of this post I will discuss the problems with currently produced decentralized systems and the design elements that should underlie a good social networking system.</p>
<h2>What are the problems with current decentralized social networks?</h2>
<p>Wikipedia has a fairly exhaustive list of current decentralized social networks. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_software_and_protocols_for_distributed_social_networking"></a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison">http:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>en.wikipedia.org/<wbr></wbr>wiki/<wbr></wbr>Comparison</a><em>of</em>software<em>and</em>protocols<em>for</em>distributed<em>social</em>networking</p>

<p>I have tried many of these systems and looked into others and none of them fit my needs or are likely to be competitors to Facebook. The largest projects Diaspora,Friendica and StatusNet are very difficult to install and configure. These projects often unnecessarily run their messages through other protocols, such as XMPP. This adds extra complexity to the system and its implementation. Other projects are defunct and have no active development. Others lack critical features and do not plan to add them in the future.</p>
<h3>What does a good network have?</h3>
<p>First I will discuss what I think a social networking application is. Then I will discuss the particular traits that one should have.</p>
<h4> What is a social network?</h4>
<p>Social networking applications are at their core messaging systems. They allow people to broadcast a message to a group of friends and/or subscribers to a page. They allow people to communicate with each other through private messages. Social networks create a easy way for users to communicate a profile about themselves. Blogging engines, like Wordpress are often confused with social networking applications</p>
<h4>Ease of use</h4>
<p>The first feature that a good social network should have is ease of use. It should be easy to use the webpage client for the network and it should be easy to install a server for the network. But by easy to use I mean <a href="http://www.over-yonder.net/~fullermd/rants/userfriendly/2"><strong>easy to learn</strong>, not easy to use without learning</a>. Easy to use without learning is the unfortunate interface design methodology employed by many businesses, including Facebook.However, it can most clearly be found in Apple's products and to a lesser extent in Microsoft's. Computers are complex devices and the easy to use without learning design methodology tries to hide this complexity from the user. This design attempts to create smart computers, but dumb users. However,easy to use without learning design hurts users in the long run. It kills the flexibility of a system, it creates software that second guesses the user at every point and this design discourages user learning, churning out "computer illiterate" users.It also adds to software complexity and bloat. The easy to learn design methodology admits that computers are complex. Users are expected to know a bit about how the system works and why they are doing what they are doing. This design allows simple flexible systems which cover many use cases.</p>
<h4>Simplicity</h4>
<p>The corollary of ease of use is simplicity. The network, and the protocol that underlies it should be as simple as possible.</p>
<h4>Split Layout and Message Data, Keep Layout on the Recipient's Side</h4>
<p>One of the reasons that Myspace collapsed is that it allowed users to change the way that their profiles looked to other users. New social networks should clearly avoid this mistake by separating the content messages, statuses and profiles from their layout. A distributed social network should allow each user to apply a theme that sets how the system displays to them but that does not affect the theme and layout shown to other users.</p>
<h4>....But allow a Wikitext Style Formatting</h4>
<p>However, Facebook went to the opposite extreme and disallowed almost all formatting codes in messages. It is not possible to add a hyperlink to a Facebook status/message, nor is it possible to bold or italicize text.A good alternative to this would be to allow the use of a formatting language like <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20150623033701/%3Ca%20href=" http:>http:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>www.wikicreole.org/<wbr></wbr></a>"&gt;WikiCreole.</p>
<h4>Detailed Privacy Settings and Post Clusters</h4>
<p>A good social networking application should have much more powerful privacy options. These should revolve around what I call "post clusters". Users should be able to categorize their friends into sub groups and set posts to be only viewable by some of these groups. A large reason why social networks that are targeted at specific purposes, like LinkedIn thrive is in part due to the poor privacy options found in most social networks. People want to broadcast different messages to business colleagues than they want to broadcast to friends. Most social networks do not allow this type of fine grained control, so users instead use different networks for each purpose.</p>

<p>As an additional privacy feature, the ideal social networking system should allow a way to anonymously send messages. The protocol of the network should also allow the use of privacy system, such as Tor.</p>
<h4>Spam Filtering</h4>
<p>Any communications network will have to face the issue of how to deal with spam. A distributed network will have to do this without adding centralization or risking user privacy. In my opinion, the best way to deal with spam would be something along the lines of<a href="http://www.templetons.com/brad/spam/endspam.html"> Brad Templeton's throttle relay proposal for email</a>. This method could be made even more powerful because a new social network would have a completely new protocol that could take into account the spam issue.</p>
<h4>Built in Encryption</h4>
<p>Encryption is necessary for privacy in a modern application. A social network should encrypt all communications between servers. It should also have client side encryption as an option, but because client side encryption can be difficult to use, it should not be mandatory for all users.</p>
<h4>Extensibility, Plugins and Themes</h4>
<p>A distributed social network should have a wordpress-style support for themes and plugins. This would greatly improve the flexibility of the system and would allow it to be customized to fit user needs.</p>
<h4>Email Replacement</h4>
<p><a href="http://paulgraham.com/ambitious.html">In an essay Paul Graham notes that email is largely used as a todo list and discusses how this role can be replaced</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>.... my inbox is a todo list, and email is the way things get onto it. But it is a disastrously bad todo list.</p>

<p>I'm open to different types of solutions to this problem, but I suspect that tweaking the inbox is not enough, and that email has to be replaced with a new protocol.  ....</p>

<p>As a todo list protocol, the new protocol should give more power to the recipient than email does. I want there to be more restrictions on what someone can put on my todo list. And when someone can put something on my todo list, I want them to tell me more about what they want from me. Do they want me to do something beyond just reading some text? How important is it? .....When does it have to be done?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A social networking system would have a-lot of the functionality needed for this to-do list. Therefore, it is possible that a to-do list protocol could be built on top of a well-designed social networking system. Current social networks have displaced much of the messaging role of email. A well-designed one could replace email wholesale.</p>
<h4>WordPress Style Business Model</h4>
<p>I assume that even if it were possible most users would not run their own servers. Therefore, there is a need for a hosted version of the application. How WordPress does could be of inspiration. WordPress provides a opensource content management system that users can run on their own, but also provides a hosted form of the blogging engine (wordpress.com).</p>
<h4>Split Server and Client</h4>
<p>When looking at the description of what a social network is you may see that there are two distinct tasks that a distributed social networking application must complete.</p>
<ol><li>A server which handles transmitting messages between programs and other servers. This is a role roughly equivalent to that of an email server.</li>
    <li>A client which displays and messages in a way that is useful for the user. This is roughly equivalent to the role of an email client, like Thunderbird or Gmail.</li>
</ol>
<p>These two roles should be two separate programs that are written to work well together.This separates the implementation of a system from its interface. This separation would make many features which would be difficult to implement in a web based client only system easy to implement. Interfaces can become obsolete quickly but protocols can last longer. The email protocol, which was designed in the 1970s is still in use, even though the original clients for email are long dead.A clear separation between server and client will extend the life of a social networking system by expanding its flexibility.</p>
<h4>New Protocol</h4>
<p>Social networks are fundamentally different from other systems. Therefore,a new protocol, one dedicated to running these networks is needed. Many previous attempts to create a decentralized social network have free loaded on already existing protocols. This only serves to create a hard to use, overly complicated system. It does not simplify the work needed to create a social network, but instead makes the lives of their designers more complex.A protocol dedicated to social networks will create a platform that programmers can work with, not against.</p>
<h4>Open Source</h4>
<p>Opensource is the only way to create a decentralized network that avoids all of the pitfalls of a centralized network.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://eprints.nottingham.ac.uk/2236/">study published this month</a> ,<em>Climate change on Twitter: topics, communities and conversations about the 2013 IPCC report</em>, looked into the debate about climate change on Twitter around the release of the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change assessment.</p>

<p>They analysed the content of  tweets that mentioned the IPCC. Most Twitter posts on climate change  Among their findings is the discovery of a clear political polarization in online discussions of this issue. The discussions largely fit into four topics, "relation to science, political campaigns, geography, and social meanings of climate change". Of particular frequency in this discussion is the debate over the carbon tax bill in Australia. The debate over the accuracy of the science strongly follows these political lines. The following two example tweets given in the paper illustrate this.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <a href="tag/Australian.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#Australian</a> PM thinks that if he doesn't read the <a href="tag/IPCC.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#IPCC</a> report then <a href="tag/climatechange.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#climatechange</a> is still crap. That's the way this government works.</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>

IPCC exposed as corrupt liars. <a href="http://t.co/rotD07eIEX"></a><a href="http://t.co/rotD07eIEX">http:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>t.co/<wbr></wbr>rotD07eIEX</a> <a href="tag/auspol.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#auspol</a> <a href="tag/ausvotes.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#ausvotes</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the United States tweets followed liberal and conservative lines with conservative tweets outnumbering liberal ones two to one. The authors state that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The dominance of conservative-leaning hashtags in the US provide support for the theory that the country’s climate debate is in danger of becoming so polarized as to be described as a “logic schism”, in a similar manner to struggles over President Obama’s healthcare program.</p>
