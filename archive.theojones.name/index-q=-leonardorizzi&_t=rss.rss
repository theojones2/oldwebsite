<p>A few months ago Intel decided to take a pro-Gamergate stance and the company pulled advertisements from anti-Gamergate publications. It was clear to everyone (except perhaps for Intel's marketing department) that siding with a movement with a severe problem of harassment of women in the tech industry and sexism would damage the company's image. And of course, it did.

Image via Flickr user  Leonardo Rizzi<br /><a href="https://flic.kr/p/7xbpVv%5B/caption%5DIntel">https:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>flic.kr/<wbr></wbr>p/<wbr></wbr>7xbpVv[/<wbr></wbr>caption]Intel</a> received an immediate backlash, and Intel's reputation with OEMs and consumers was damaged as a result. Through direct builds of my own and advice to friends and relatives, I was involved in a number of computer purchases since this incident. All run AMD CPUs. The Intel backing of Gamergate was a non-trivial part of this decision. Intel now has a problem, a problem that they tried to fix by throwing money at the issue. Today <a href="http://arstechnica.com/business/2015/01/intel-pledges-300-million-to-improve-diversity-in-tech/">Intel announced their intent to donate $300 million to tech diversity initiatives</a>. However, this is not sufficient to relieve Intel of their issue. The fact that Intel would not only back a toxic movement such as GG, but also back one of their most toxic efforts (an attempt to retaliate against journalists who published articles that GG did not like) indicates a severe problem at Intel's culture. A problem that will take much more than money to fix, and until Intel does that, this scandal will be a black mark on the company's record.</p>
