            </h2>
                    <p class="reading">
                <span class="vague">3 min read </span>
            </p>
            
<p>While there are many things we should be concerned about with the NSA's vast data collection programs, in my opinion the worst is the fact that politicians are making many critical decisions about our privacy rights in secret without public debate. This secrecy is an assault on the basic principles of the rule of law and democracy.</p>

<p>As the<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/07/us/in-secret-court-vastly-broadens-powers-of-nsa.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp;"> New York Times reports t</a>he court has "created a secret body of law" and has assumed a role that is greatly beyond its initial purpose of "approving case-by-case wiretapping orders". In secret, and without making public any justifications for its decisions, the court has approved vast data collection programs. <a href="http://wonkette.com/521997/fisa-court-busy-making-awesome-secret-law-awesomely-in-secret">Additionally</a> the court , has reinterpreted the definition of “foreign intelligence” to include not just communications involving a foreign national, but also many communications between Americans. The FISA court <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/08/new-leak-nsa-can-search-us-e-mail-data-but-theoretically-isnt-allowed-to/">has declared</a> that the NSA can collect all American email data and create a system that allows this data to be searched -- even when the emails are between Americans using an American service provider. It is likely that the NSA has used this power to search American emails.Why won't the FISA court release summaries of its rulings? As the top judge on the court explains, the public <a href="http://www.fas.org/irp/agency/doj/fisa/fisc-032713.pdf">cannot be trusted to "understand"</a> the decisions -- especially after important details are edited out of released opinions. Furthermore, actually giving the public even a summary of what the government is doing on its behalf would overwork the judges so much that the expanded workload  "would have a detrimental impact on the FISC's ability to address matters currently before the court" because "small number of judges, attorneys, and staff that comprise the FISC are fully occupied by its current caseload".</p>

<p>Why do I call this great secrecy the worst element of the NSA program? In a free society it is necessary that policy makers are held to governing in the public's interest, not their own. The only way to make sure that the government is held accountable is to create a political and legal system where voters and the public have the ability to effectively contest government policy. The public must know what the government is doing on its behalf in-order to evaluate the actions of the state. A secret court is unable to fully hear and take into account opposing arguments. Furthermore, even if the NSA program turns out to be legal, secret decisions cannot be contested on election day and the politicians who allowed the spying program will not face any consequences if they have made a bad call. It is ultimately the task of voters' to decide if the NSA programs have employed the proper level of protections for privacy but if the executive branch orders and court decisions allowing these programs are not known to the public, voters will not be able to make this evaluation.</p>

<p>[caption id="attachment_317" align="alignright" width="203"] Unveiling of the Statue of Liberty Enlightening the World (1886) by Edward Moran[/caption]</p>

<p>What are the values that have made America and Americans different? An American can be of any race, creed, religion, philosophy, or ethnicity. The United States has never been a country of one religious or ethnic group, and Americans have many diverse political philosophies. The ideal of America has been that of a country where immigrants from throughout the world could come and make a good life and where Americans from all socioeconomic backgrounds could move up the economic ladder, or at the least attain a good education and provide for themselves and their families if they work hard. America has always been a melting pot and a nation of diversity. America is a home for persons of all types­­ there is no one stereotypical real American.</p>

<p>Americans enjoy freedom of speech and religion and live under a legal system that protects these basic individual rights. What makes a real American is the strong belief in these values and the freedoms that come with being a citizen of the United States, as well as respect for those values and freedoms. The United States was founded to be a country where the most famous lines of the Declaration of Independence -- a document ratified 237 years ago today -- ring true, where “<em>We hold these truths to be self­ evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.</em>”</p>
<div title="Page 1">
<p>America was founded to be a nation of laws, not men, where there would never be a European­style aristocracy and where all were equal in rights and opportunity. These values are inherently both communal and individual as both liberty and equality involve the relations between individuals to other individuals in society. Because of this, the power of community has been at the heart of what makes America great. While these values and hopes have never been fully implemented, and there are still great inequities in American society, these values form the heart and soul of America and its people.</p>
<div title="Page 1">
<p>The fact that America is a nation of diversity can be seen in where Americans have come from. There have been Americans that have come from almost all cultural groups in the world.</p>
<div title="Page 2">
<p>Starting even before independence, America has been a melting pot of immigrants of different cultures and religions. British Puritans and Pilgrims migrated to the New World for religious liberty and settled in New England and founded the colonies of Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Connecticut. Quaker immigrants settled Pennsylvania looking for religious freedom. Pennsylvania after Quaker settlement was the first colony to provide religious freedom to all and soon became home to individuals of many religions. The Dutch founded what is now New York City, but this land was eventually absorbed into the British Empire. New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Delaware attracted many Irish, German and Scandinavian immigrants. By 1790 almost one half of the American population was not of British ancestry. Restrictions on immigration and importation of goods imposed by the British were a significant cause of the American Revolution. One of the grievances against the British monarch stated in the Declaration of Independence is that “<em>He has endeavored to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither</em>... “</p>
<div title="Page 2">
<p>After independence, the United States immigration laws were extremely permissive. The Naturalization Act of 1790, which was the first U. S. immigration law, placed no restrictions on immigration and allowed free whites to obtain citizenship after two years of residency in the United States. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, the United States had a free migration policy and had massive flows of immigrants from European nations, such as Ireland, and immigrants from Asia. This migration was its strongest around the time of the Irish Potato Famine. The inscription on the Statue of Liberty greeted the immigrants entering the country through Ellis Island with the following poem written by Emma Lazarus and titled The New Colossus. It summed up America's values toward immigrants,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame, With conquering limbs astride from land to land; Here at our sea­washed, sunset gates shall stand A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name Mother of Exiles. From her beacon­ hand Glows world­ wide welcome; her mild eyes command The air-­bridged harbor that twin cities frame. 'Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!' cries she With silent lips. 'Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest ­tossed to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!'”</p>
</blockquote><div title="Page 3">
<p>America was open to immigrants throughout the world and was a nation of opportunities. It is clear that this history has made the United States a nation of diversity created by immigrants from all over the world. This American history of immigration is what makes being American not about what religious or ethnic group you are part of, but about the American values of liberty and equality that are so eloquently summed up by The New Colossus. American values have always been to create a nation where people from throughout the world could come to experience liberty and opportunity. What makes an American is therefore belief in these values, the values that have attracted and brought so many immigrants to the United States.</p>
<div title="Page 3">
<p>The core values of America that shape and created the nation are liberty and equality. These values have drawn immigrants to the nation since the Puritans, Pilgrims and Quakers first set foot in the New World looking for religious liberty. It is these values that define what being an American is and form the basis of the American community. America was founded to be a place where no king could arbitrarily interfere with basic liberties. Freedom and equality come hand in hand and cannot exist without each other.</p>
<div title="Page 3">
<p>Freedom in the American community means not being dominated over, and living in a community with other citizens that are equal in rights and opportunities. American poet and author Walt Whitman defined freedom as follows, “<em>Freedom --­ to walk free and own no superior.</em>“ and said this of being a citizen of America, “<em>Neither a servant nor a master am I</em>.” These values have motivated American activists throughout the nation's history to fight for what is right and to fight to bring liberty and equal opportunity to all.</p>
<div title="Page 3">
<p>The founders of the United States saw freedom and equality as inherently linked. Excessive inequality could result in aristocracy and would be corrosive to society and freedom. But freedom was inherently linked with accepting that all men are created equal. Alexis de Tocqueville, a famous French author who wrote about the early United States, said, “<em>Grant me thirty years of equal division of inheritances and a free press, and I will provide you with a republic.</em>” In the Federalist #10, James Madison stated that “<em>the most common and durable source of factions has been the various and unequal distribution of property. Those who hold and those who are without property have ever formed distinct interests in society.</em>”</p>
<div title="Page 4">
<p>The struggle for freedom and equality for all has defined the United States throughout its history and defines what it means to be an American. The biggest questions in American history have been “what is liberty?” and “what is the proper relation between liberty and order?” and the biggest struggles in American history have involved expanding freedom and equality. The greatest victories in these struggles have come in four waves. The first wave of this struggle came with the Revolutionary War and the formation of the new United States government. The second wave of the American struggle for freedom for all came with the U.S Civil War and its aftermath. The third wave of this struggle came with the Great Depression, the New Deal and the Second World War and its aftermath. The fourth wave was the Civil Rights Movement. The Declaration of Independence was the statement of the core values of America and its people. However, the realization that “<em>all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights</em>” came throughout the history of the United States and is still not entirely complete. The Declaration of Independence stated that the role of government ought to be to protect these rights and that a just government is based around the consent of the governed. After independence, American society became the closest in existence to a society without an aristocracy. A government was created that was the closest thing to a republic of laws, not men, that existed in the world. About a decade after the end of the revolution, a constitution was ratified that created a new national government for the United States. In its Preamble the Constitution stated its purpose as follows, “<em>to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity.</em>” Shortly thereafter, a second great American document was created, the Bill of Rights. This document protected many fundamental rights from government violation. Through many years of existence and legal interpretation, the Bill of Rights became a great American document that has played a large role in determining the nature of American freedom and liberty and has been at the heart of the shared American historical and cultural heritage. These documents are part of what makes America what it is and Americans who they are.</p>
<div title="Page 5">
<p>The history of the Civil War and reconstruction resulted in a great expansion of liberty, the end of slavery, and the expansion of the rights of citizenship to many Americans who did not receive those liberties before. The legal changes that happened during this period are most dramatically reflected in the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, which reads in part, “<em>No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.</em>” The 14th Amendment's declaration that all are equal before the law put the Declaration of Independence's most famous value into the constitution. It stated that all Americans have rights that must be protected by law. Furthermore, the Civil War and its aftermath helped define what it means to be American by creating an American national identity. Americans were Americans first and foremost instead of residents of their states first and foremost.</p>
<div title="Page 5">
<p>The New Deal era and the aftermath of World War II brought a new era in the expansion of rights in the United States. During the New Deal, it was realized that liberty included certain economic rights and that protecting the liberty of the population included giving everyone economic opportunities. In a tradition that went back to the nation's founding, it was realized that excessive concentrations of wealth were harmful and made it difficult to maintain the conditions needed for freedom to continue. The Second World War and its aftermath saw the exportation of the American values of freedom for all to the rest of the world. During the war, President Franklin D. Roosevelt made his Four Freedoms speech in which he stated that freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom from fear, and freedom from want were human rights that ought to be protected for all persons everywhere in the world. This speech served to be an inspiration for the development of the United Nations after the war, and the expansion of human rights to everyone throughout the world. The civil rights movement that started in the 1950s expanded the horizons of American liberty and freedom. The formal racial segregation and discrimination of the Jim Crow era was ended and economic discrimination was reduced. Courts made important civil rights and civil liberties decisions that expanded liberty and equality for all. Economic programs such Lyndon Johnson's Great Society expanded opportunity and alleviated poverty. During the 1970s and 80s women's rights were established and expanded., in a large part due to court victories won by activists.</p>
<div title="Page 6"><div title="Page 6">America is a nation of diversity created by a history of immigration, a nation not made of any one cultural or religious group. This nation has been a place where people of all kinds came for a better life throughout its entire history. This has been true since even before U.S independence. From Quaker and Puritan immigrants looking for religious freedom, to the immigrants of Ellis Island to modern immigrants, people have come to America looking for freedom. America has been a nation of ideals and laws, not of men or aristocracy, throughout its history. These values of freedom and equality have inspired struggle for all of America's history. While these struggles have never created a perfect union, America has become more perfect and a greater home to the blessings of liberty over its history. What makes a real American is not simply who you are, but it is our shared values and the belief that you have the freedom and opportunity to become all that you want to be, as long as you don't violate the freedoms and liberties of others. It is this belief in liberty and equality for all that makes America great and makes being an American great. The constitution gives Americans certain rights and our freedom and liberty are guaranteed. But what makes an American a real American is the respect for these values and the respect for the struggle that secured these freedoms, as well as a determination to continue to protect and fight for these values.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><p><a href="tag/ellisisland.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#ellisisland</a> <a href="tag/newdeal.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#newdeal</a> <a href="tag/newworld.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#newworld</a> <a href="tag/old.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#old</a> <a href="tag/old.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#old</a> <a href="tag/uncategorized.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#uncategorized</a> <a href="tag/unitedstates.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#unitedstates</a></p></div>                    </div>

<p>How about 117 degrees Fahrenheit for hot weather? <a href="http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/heat-wave-unabated-rajasthan-s-sriganganagar-sizzles-at-48-2-degrees-370148">This was the high temperature during last month's heat wave in Sriganganagar, India</a>. While single events, including this heat wave, cannot be attributed individually to climate change, global warming will make such events much more likely. The planet is undergoing one of the most rapid periods of temperature change in the history of the Earth. This level of change is only exceeded by what occurred during the five mass extinctions, the most recent of these being the Cretaceous-Tertiary event which caused the extinction of the dinosaurs. The rate of biodiversity loss due to current human caused climate change may be <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/Default.aspx?id=3897120&amp;p1=0#.UZ2bu3wy0b0">sufficient to qualify as a mass extinction fully on par</a> with these events by mid-century.</p>

<p>In this article, I will show the evidence that there is an increase in global temperature of about 0.16 degrees Celsius per decade. The following chart from NASA shows the rise of global average temperature to a level that is 1.5C above pre-industrial levels and 0.6C above mid-20th century levels.</p>

<p>[caption id="attachment_159" align="aligncenter" width="300"] Click to enlarge image. <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/news/topstory/2008/earth_temp.html">Image description from NASA</a>: "Graph of global annual surface temperatures relative to 1951-1980 mean temperature. Air and ocean data from weather stations, ships and satellites. The 2007 point is the 11-month anomaly."[/caption]</p>

<p>This graph clearly shows a dramatic and exponential rise in global surface temperatures. While often criticized, researchers have confirmed this general temperature trend many times. A <a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/2012/07/berkeley-earth-project-is-back-to-re-re-confirm-earth-is-warming/">recent confirmation of this data was done by former climate change skeptic Richard Muller</a> in his <a href="http://berkeleyearth.org">Berkeley Earth</a> project. Muller was funded by many conservative groups which believed that his work offered one of the best opportunities for a scientific falsification of global warming theory.As the following chart shows, the Berkeley Earth results are effectively the same as previous attempts to measure global temperature.</p>

<p>[caption id="attachment_163" align="aligncenter" width="300"] Click to enlarge image. "Land temperature with 1- and 10-year running averages. The shaded regions are the one- and two-standard deviation uncertainties calculated including both statistical and spatial sampling errors. Prior land results from the other groups are also plotted. The NASA GISS record had a land mask applied; the HadCRU curve is the simple land average, not the hemispheric-weighted one." Image and caption from Berkeley Earth <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130723044740/%3Ca%20href=" http:>http:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>berkeleyearth.org:80/<wbr></wbr>results-summary/<wbr></wbr></a>"&gt;<a href="http://berkeleyearth.org/results-summary/%5B/caption">http:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>berkeleyearth.org/<wbr></wbr>results-summary/<wbr></wbr>[/<wbr></wbr>caption</a>]The above chart compares the temperature reconstructions made by Berkeley Earth with other temperature measurements, including the NASA results used in the first graph. All of the major data sets come to effectively the same result for recent temperatures. Despite claims from climate change skeptics that "urban heating, data selection, poor station quality, and data adjustment" has biased past attempts to measure global temperatures, Berkeley Earth has found that "these [factors] do not unduly bias the results".</p>

<p>There are many short-term effects such as the El Nino, La Nina cycle that can cause temporary reductions in global temperatures. But as the following animation shows these effects do not nullify the greater global temperature trends.</p>

<p>The current rapid increases in global temperature can be confirmed in other ways. As this image produced by the Environmental Protection Agency shows, Arctic ice is melting at a rapid rate.</p>

<p>[caption id="attachment_172" align="aligncenter" width="300"] Click to enlarge.[/caption]</p>

<p>In a period of just 28 years, climate change reduced Arctic ice by over a third. Ice melts when heated. This reduction in ice coverage reflects and supports the conclusion that temperatures are soaring.Temperatures in the Arctic have increased at a rate four times the world average.</p>

<p>The case that the world is warming is very strong. As I will show in my next post, we are causing this increase. If this increase in global temperature continues, the results will be catastrophic.</p>

<p>The Interstate 5 bridge over the Skagit River in Washington state <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/05/23/1211354/-I-5-bridge-over-Skagit-River-collapses-cars-with-people-in-water">collapsed last week</a> causing no deaths, but the collapse injured <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/24/washington-bridge-collapse_n_3331536.html">at least three people</a>. It is clear that the officials responsible for maintaining the bridge did not have the funding needed to keep the bridge system in good repair. This incident showcases the need for a massive, Works Progress Administration style push to repair our infrastructure.</p>

<p>Before I go into what needs to be done with our infrastructure, let's first review what happened in Washington .As reported by KOMO.News, a local television station, a Washington Department of Transportation spokesperson <a href="http://www.komonews.com/news/local/Cars-bodies-in-Skagit-River-after-I-5-Bridge-collapse--208760201.html">was not aware when the bridge was last inspected</a>. Furthermore, the Federal Highway Administration classified the bridge as "functionally obsolete" because it had an outdated design that does not meet current standards for new bridge construction. From KOMO,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bart Treece with WDOT was unsure when the bridge was last inspected.  <br />"All of our bridges in the area are pretty old," he said.  <br />The bridge is not considered structurally deficient but is listed as being "functionally obsolete" - a category meaning that their design is outdated, such as having narrow shoulders are low clearance underneath, according to a database compiled by the Federal Highway Administration.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There were other issues with the bridge and many others in the state.A 1992 federal report <a href="http://uglybridges.com/1589303">recommended that the I-5 bridge be replaced</a> at a cost of 8.3 million dollars. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20131029033245/%3Ca%20href=" http:>http:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>blogs.asce.org/<wbr></wbr>govrel/<wbr></wbr>2013/<wbr></wbr>05/<wbr></wbr>21/<wbr></wbr>washington-state-report-card-released-today/<wbr></wbr></a>"&gt;37 percent of the state's bridges have been in use for a time frame exceeding their designed lifespan. According to the Seattle Times,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The bridge, built in 1955, has a sufficiency rating of 57.4 out of 100, according to federal records. That is well below the statewide average rating of 80, according to an Associated Press analysis of federal data, but 759 bridges in the state have a lower sufficiency score.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The fact that the I-5 Bridge and many like it have not received needed maintenance shows the need for new investment in infrastructure. The government needs to commit o<a href="http://www.infrastructurereportcard.org/a/#p/bridges/investment-and-funding">ver 120 billion dollars</a> to fix our bridges. <a href="http://www.infrastructurereportcard.org/a/#p/bridges/overview">Budgets for future road repairs need</a> to be increased by 8 billion dollars per year. Despite the clear facts, politicians have done just the opposite.  As the graph I open my blog post with shows, spending on infrastructure has actually decreased during the ongoing recession.</p>

<p>To supplement and complete infrastructure investment the federal government should enact a Works Progress Administration style jobs push. The government should pledge to hire anyone willing and able to work at minimum wage and put those hired to work on public projects, including infrastructure improvements.This program should continue even after unemployment is lowered to regular levels. A major push on infrastructure will create many jobs and many workers will be hired to complete the construction work. The current high level of unemployment shows that there is much surplus economic  capacity able to be put to work.</p>

<p>In a depressed economy the United States government can increase spending without the need for increased taxation or other ill effects. The deficit is not a limiting factor for government investment. A country with its own, floating, non-convertable (a currency where the issuer does not pledge to convert currency for a commodity on demand) currency is not constrained in its government spending by absolute debt or deficit levels. The<a href="http://neweconomicperspectives.org/2012/01/mmp-blog-31-functional-finance-monetary.html"> only constraints on spending are the effects that the spending has on inflation, unemployment, demand</a> and other economic outcomes.</p>

<p>Any complaints that the debt would be increased by infrastructure improvements are not grounds to let our roads and bridges rot. There are many needed infrastructure improvements. The government should start on them as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Is the idea of global warming a new concept--just a fad-- something dreamed up by tree huggers and Al Gore with scientists jumping on the propaganda bandwagon? Climate change denialists, like <a href="http://wattsupwiththat.com/">Anthony Watts</a> [1. See for instance this article <a href="http://wattsupwiththat.com/2011/06/25/the-end-is-near-for-faith-in-agw/"></a><a href="http://wattsupwiththat.com/2011/06/25/the-end-is-near-for-faith-in-agw/">http:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>wattsupwiththat.com/<wbr></wbr>2011/<wbr></wbr>06/<wbr></wbr>25/<wbr></wbr>the-end-is-near-for-faith-in-agw/<wbr></wbr></a>], would have you believe that. But the truth is scientists have been studying it for more than 100 years.</p>

<p>The first scientist that theorized the possibility that the combustion of coal fuels could result in a global increase in temperature was chemist Svante Arrhenius,</p>

<p>[caption id="attachment_105" align="alignright" width="239"] Svante Arrhenius (<a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Arrhenius2.jpg">Image from Wikimedia Commons</a>)[/caption]</p>

<p><a href="http://www.aip.org/history/climate/co2.htm">who in 1896 theorized that coal burning could warm the climate at a scale similar to the effect caused by geologic sources</a>, such as volcanoes. He first estimated that a carbon dioxide increase sufficient to double CO2, and thereby increase global temperatures by 5 degrees Celsius, would take a few thousand years. By 1908, he had reduced this estimate to a few hundred years. However, Arrhenius' model of the climate was simplistic and the possibility that human activity and changes in CO2 level could increase global temperature was disregarded until the 1950s.</p>

<p>During that decade, new models were created that added support to this theory, but the evidence was still not conclusive. In the late 1970s, this began to change. Computers allowed the creation of accurate and detailed estimates of the possibility of human-caused climate change, and these estimates were calculated and widely accepted. In 1979, the United States National Academy of Sciences released a report warning of human-caused climate change [2. Archer, David, and Stefan Rahmstorf. The climate crisis: an introductory guide to climate change. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2010. Page x.], marking the first general acceptance of this theory.</p>

<p>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was created in 1988 to study the possibility of climate change and its impacts. The first IPCC report, published in 1990, found that a human-caused increase in global temperatures was likely, but not conclusive. The IPCC also found that the evidence should be conclusive within a decade. In their 2007 assessment on the physical science basis of climate change, the fourth and most recent assessment available at this time, the IPCC found that levels of three greenhouse gasses, carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, in the atmosphere had increased dramatically since the Industrial Revolution. According to the IPCC, these increases in greenhouse gasses have warmed and changed the climate and are human caused with a very high probability. Out of the three, the effect of carbon dioxide is the most significant.</p>

<p>Over 97 percent of climate scientists agree that human-caused climate change is happening and has the potential to cause severe harm. Some might say that this means nothing. But I believe that when 97 percent of scientists believe something, we should listen, especially when there is a whole century of evidence to back them up.</p>

<p><strong>This blog post is the first in a series where I will explore the science behind climate change, the effects of climate change and solutions to the climate change problem.  </strong></p><p>Earlier this month atmospheric carbon dioxide levels exceeded 400 parts per million for the first time in recorded history, <a href="http://www.skepticalscience.com/pliocene-snapshot.html"> and most likely for the first time in three million years</a>. The evidence is clear that climate change is occurring and that it is a very significant global problem. Global warming is primarily caused by humans and there are policy and economic changes that can reduce it in the future. Ninety-seven percent of climatologists agree with this mainstream view and no scientific body in the natural sciences of international standing disagrees with it.</p><p> As the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found in its most recent assessment, changes to the climate, caused by CO2 and other greenhouse gasses, will create extreme weather patterns,raise sea levels, and decrease sea ice levels. Global temperatures have increased to a level not exceeded for the last 125,000 years. Current changes to the climate will have effects that could last for hundreds of years. If measures are not taken to reduce current emissions levels, significant additional climate change will almost certainly happen.</p><p><a href="http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss2/art32/main.html">A 2009 study found that</a> maintaining a climate and global ecosystem that is fundamentally similar to the one that has existed over the last 10,000 years will require the change in radiative forcing to be limited to 1 watt per square meter-- roughly equivalent to limiting CO2 levels to 350 parts per million. This is compared to current levels of 1.5 watts per square meter and 400 parts per million.The same paper also found that biodiversity loss has already increased to more than 10 times a sustainable or desirable level and found human-caused disruptions to the nitrogen cycle that exceeded what ecosystems can sustain without severe disruption.</p><p>To restore CO2 levels to this sustainable level is possible but will take a massive investment and this investment must start now. However, the fact that CO2 levels were allowed to reach 400 without any urgent climate change mitigation plan in sight shows that we are not currently on a sustainable path and that substantial additional action is needed to prevent a calamity.</p><p><a href="tag/climatechange.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#climatechange</a> <a href="tag/old.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#old</a> <a href="tag/old.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#old</a> <a href="tag/uncategorized.html" class="p-category" rel="tag">#uncategorized</a></p></div>                    </div>

<p>Politicians, driven by faulty economic theories and their own political ambitions, are again thinking about taking the nation's reputation hostage and gambling with America's future. Yes, the Republicans seem to be planning another debt ceiling crisis. <a title="According to the Los Angeles Times" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130614000138/%3Ca%20href=" http:>http:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>www.latimes.com/<wbr></wbr>business/<wbr></wbr>la-fi-debt-limit-20130510,0,7705505.story</a>" target="_blank"&gt;According to the Los Angeles Times, the party's legislators want "tangible progress on overhauling the tax code" in return for a debt ceiling increase.</p>

<p>The debt ceiling limits the the number of government bonds that can be issued. Although a debt ceiling increase does not authorize additional spending, under current government practice, debt issue is needed to meet commitments already made by Congress. If the debt ceiling is not raised, the United States government will default on obligations committed to by existing law. The U.S Treasury would not be able to make payments on all government liabilities and programs, or would have to resort to unconventional means to fund the government deficit. Many major government programs would necessarily face rapid cuts. The economic consequences of such a default could be disastrous. Let's first look at what would have happened if the debt limit was not increased during the 2011 crisis. <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2011/02/17/news/economy/debt_limit_spending_cuts/index.htm?iid=EL" target="_blank">According to CNN</a>, the cuts required would have been equivalent to the any of the following: the amount spent on “all discretionary spending, including defense,” plus 50 billion dollars; 70 percent of the funds spent on Social Security or Medicare; or two-thirds of total government tax revenue.Additional cuts would have been needed to cover the government through 2012, or to account for the effect that depressed private spending would have had on the economy. Clearly, suddenly disbanding the military or ending Social Security would not be good policy. But unrealistic budget slashing of that magnitude is proposed when the Tea Party demands that their ideology rule the day, regardless of whether it's supported by sound economic theory or the majority of the nation's voters.<br />If the debt ceiling is not raised this year, the program cuts made necessary by this inaction will be very harsh. Budget reductions amounting to between four to five percent of GDP, or about one-half of those that would have been required during the 2011 crisis, will be necessary. Obviously, this would be very harmful. The decreases in government spending that would be required would also immediately reduce economic output. This is because decreases in government spending will directly reduce demand for products. The possible supply of goods and services in the current depressed economy is substantially greater than the demand for these goods. Therefore, an increase in demand will increase economic production in the current situation because businesses will have the capacity to absorb it. But if the debt ceiling isn't raised, just the opposite will happen. Demand and output will be reduced by a decrease in government spending because less money will be around to purchase American products. Government contracts with businesses may be canceled or the amount spent decreased. Benefit reductions will also lessen demand for goods and services. If food stamp benefits are reduced, grocery purchases will decrease. Social Security and unemployment benefit recipients are all buyers of goods and services. With less money, they too will buy less.<br />In fact, the cuts can be expected to reduce demand more than just their raw value. And they would disproportionately harm the poor and middle class, who spend most of their income and have low rates of savings. One person's spending is another's income. Government programs like food stamps and unemployment benefits are extremely good at stimulating demand. <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/18958475" target="_blank">According to an article published in The Economist</a>, “When Moody’s Analytics assessed different forms of stimulus, it found that food stamps were the most effective, increasing economic activity by $1.73 for every dollar spent. Unemployment insurance came in second, at $1.62, whereas most tax cuts yielded a dollar or less.”<br />Failing to raise the debt ceiling would hurt the U.S. government and the economy in one other way that is even more detrimental than the effects of budget reductions. A default on government obligations would cause serious harm. A default would occur if the government failed to pay past commitments made by Congress. If the debt ceiling is not raised, the president and the treasury will be obligated to violate at least one law, either a law allocating funds to a government program, or the debt ceiling law itself. As the Supreme Court ruled in Train v. City of New York (1975), the treasury is obligated to disburse all funds allocated by Congress. The cuts made in this fashion will be made without public debate and will not be made through the regular political process. They will be made by orders made by executive branch officials. The ability for the public to debate and contest such cuts is limited and great legislative power–the ability to dissolve or dramatically reduce programs enacted by Congress– would be transferred to the executive.<br />The procedure to avoid default is simple. All Congress has to do is pass a debt ceiling extension. Debt ceiling raises have not been such intense issues in the past. <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2011/01/03/news/economy/debt_ceiling_faqs/index.htm" target="_blank">The debt ceiling has been raised 74 times since March 1962, before it became a major political issue</a>.All that is needed to avoid an economic crisis is a return to this previous pattern where debt ceiling votes are not held up as political tools.<br />This latest game from the Republican Party is just a simple shakedown that lacks even a superficial connection to fixing the debt. Instead of budget cuts, or a budget program, what is being demanded are changes to the fundamental structure of tax policy. The tax reform proposals supported by the Republicans will not reduce the debt, just change the distributional effects of the tax code in a way that benefits the wealthy. In fact, a majority of Republicans have signed a no-tax-increase pledge. Those truly concerned about the deficit would not be proposing tax cuts that would reduce government revenue.<br />Why not eliminate the deficit? A deficit is necessary at many times for two reasons. The first is that when the economy is below full-employment, government deficit spending is often the only way to restore the economy. The second is that <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/johntharvey/2012/07/18/why-you-should-love-government-deficits/" target="_blank">a government surplus necessarily means a private sector that is as a whole running a deficit</a>. By accounting identity, net (domestic) private savings equals the sum of the government deficit and the trade balance (positive if a trade surplus, negative if a trade deficit).The only way that the U.S government can be in surplus when there is a trade deficit is if, on average, households and domestic businesses are in deficit. Large private debts are inherently more harmful than government debts because households and businesses have finances that are much more constrained than the finances of the government.<br />Republicans have learned that shakedowns like this work because Obama has folded before. The majority of the Republican party has also been cowed by the risk of a primary challenge from the <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/127181/tea-partiers-fairly-mainstream-demographics.aspx" target="_blank">28 percent of the population that supports the extremists of the Tea Party</a>. It is high time that we stop this small minority from setting the nation's agenda. The fact that the Tea Party, and its supporters, want to risk irreparable, long-term damage to the nation to achieve short-term political goals makes such an extreme political movement unfit to govern.</p>

<p>The Second Amendment does not forbid moderate gun regulations. While there is an individual right to keep and bear arms, both the history behind the Amendment and current legal interpretation does not make this right as broad and as absolute as freedom of speech and other civil liberties. This is because the Second Amendment created an individual right in order to serve a collective purpose. The framers of the constitution believed that an armed populace in near universal militia service was a vehicle to protect individual rights. While there is a right for individuals to keep and bear arms, some limits on this right are within the government's power.</p>

<p>The framers of the United States Bill of Rights planned a military system based around broad based service where most adult males were expected to serve in a militia. Gun ownership was to be part of this militia system. Individuals would keep their personal military weapon but be expected to participate in and be trained as part of the military service. This tying of national service and gun ownership created a system where gun ownership was common but not necessarily restriction free. The intent of the founders was to create a military and gun ownership system that would of been similar to the current Swiss system. The framers of the U.S Constitution were not uniformly opposed to standing armies, but believed that they were potentially dangerous and one way of containing this danger was universal service in militias and a therefore more limited standing army. In the founders' view a large militia with broad based service supplemented by a smaller standing army was the optimal military and the one best suited to preserve liberty. Additionally, the founders also viewed individual gun ownership outside of a militia as important to the public interest and as a necessary supplement to militia service.</p>

<p>The militia clause of the Amendment states the purpose of the Second Amendment but the "right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed" clause of the Amendment is the effective part of the amendment. The Amendment provided that "right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed" because an armed population and a "regulated militia" is "necessary to the security of a free state".</p>

<p>This history and the wording of the Second Amendment create make both the collective right view and the individual rights view of the Amendment partiality correct. But both views are too extreme and contain severe flaws. The Second Amendment created an individual right in order to serve a collective purpose. In the mind of the framers of the U.S Constitution an armed populace in near universal militia service was a vehicle to protect individual rights. Contrary to the collective rights view promoted by many gun control advocates there is an individual right to keep and bear arms. However, the pure individual rights view promoted by groups such as the National Rifle Association is also incorrect as many restrictions are permissible because wide spread gun ownership was viewed as a means to protect liberty and not a fundamental liberty in itself.</p>

<p>While there is a right for individuals to keep and bear arms, some limits on this right are within the government's power because the individual right portion of the Amendment can not be interpreted so broadly as to harm the public interest. The individual right to keep and bear arms should not be interpreted to provide an absolute right akin to freedom of speech or freedom of religion but should be instead interpreted to provide a weaker right.</p>

<p>Alexander Hamilton in <i>Federalist No. 29</i> explained both the utility of an nationally organized militia and how the formation of a militia relates to the general armament of the population (emphasis added).</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>It requires no skill in the science of war to discern that uniformity in the organization and discipline of the militia would be attended with the most beneficial effects, whenever they were called into service for the public defense. …. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">This desirable uniformity can only be accomplished by confiding the regulation of the militia to the direction of the national authority. ....<br /></span><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Little more can reasonably be aimed at with the respect to the people at large than to have them properly armed and equipped ; and in order to see that this be not neglected, it will be necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course of a year.</span></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However,in the Founders' view bearing arms had utility to the public outside just militia service. An armed population, especially one with high militia service created a decentralize way to protect liberty and to prevent the formation of an authoritarian regime. James Madison in Federalist No. 46 wrote</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Besides the advantage of being armed, which the Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation, the existence of subordinate governments,to which the people are attached, forms a barrier against the enterprises of ambition, more insurmountable than any which a simple government of any form can admit of. Notwithstanding the military establishments in the several kingdoms of Europe, which are carried as far as the public resources will bear, the governments are afraid to trust the people with arms. And it is not certain, that with this aid alone they would not be able to shake off their yokes. But were the people to possess the additional advantages of local governments chosen by themselves, who could collect the national will and direct the national force, and of officers appointed out of the militia, by these governments, and attached both to them and to the militia, it may be affirmed with the greatest assurance, that the throne of every tyranny in Europe would be speedily overturned in spite of the legions which surround it.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>While the second amendment protects individual gun ownership and prevents a complete gun ban , the rationale for protecting individual gun ownership is one based on protecting the collective interest. The Constitution does not forbid reasonable and necessary restrictions on the sale and distribution of firearms. This is consistent with current court rulings, which state that there is an individual right to keep and bear arms but allow for substantial limits on that right. The Supreme Court in the majority opinion in <i>District of Colombia vs Heller </i><i>(2008)</i> stated that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<i>Although we do not undertake an exhaustive historical analysis today of the full scope of the Second Amendment, nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.</i>”</p>

            </p>
            
<p>300,000, 13,000, and 893. These three numbers will help you understand why global warming and our nation's fossil fuel dependency are grave issues that merit immediate attention.</p>

<p>300,000 represents the number of people who die each year due to the effects of global warming,<a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/europe/05/29/annan.climate.change.human/"> according to a study by the Global Humanitarian Forum</a>, a think tank headed by former United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan. Of those 300,000 deaths, 90 percent were due to malnutrition and disease caused by environmental degradation in developing nations. Additional deaths were caused by weather-related disasters.</p>

<p>300,000 is the number of Americans who die each year due to particle pollution from power plants, according to <a href="http://www.lung.org/about-us/our-impact/top-stories/toxic-air-coal-fired-power-plants.html"> a study by the American Lung Association.</a> That same study also found that "Coal-fired power plants that sell electricity to the grid produce more hazardous air pollution in the U.S. than any other industrial pollution sources".</p>

<p><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20120718072711/%3Ca%20href=" http:>http:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>mediakit.motherjones.com:80/<wbr></wbr>blue-marble/<wbr></wbr>2011/<wbr></wbr>08/<wbr></wbr>carbon-dioxide-emissions-cost-economy-underestimated</a>"&gt;$893 is the economic damage that each ton of emitted carbon dioxide causes.The total cost of the damage done by all CO2 pollution that the average American produces in a year is almost $15,000 (the per capita CO2 emissions of the United States is 17.5 tons).</p>

<p>Polluting industries, such coal, oil and gas, make their profits by not cleaning up the messes they make. They are profitable only because they are not paying the full costs of doing business and instead are placing those costs on the public.Natural resources are never free and they are not limitless. By destroying them now we are depriving future generations of their use and placing the costs of their depletion elsewhere.</p>

<p>Global warming is real and the damage it causes is already devastating to people throughout the world and to the world economy. We have an ethical obligation to rapidly reduce CO2 emissions now and move our economy towards sustainability and alternative energy sources.A full presentation of the scientific evidence for global warming is out of the scope of this blog post, but if you're interested, see this article for a basic overview <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20150325153156/%3Ca%20href=" http:>http:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>physics.ucsd.edu/<wbr></wbr>do-the-math/<wbr></wbr>2011/<wbr></wbr>08/<wbr></wbr>recipe-for-climate-change/<wbr></wbr></a>"&gt;<a href="http://physics.ucsd.edu/do-the-math/2011/08/recipe-for-climate-change/">http:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>physics.ucsd.edu/<wbr></wbr>do-the-math/<wbr></wbr>2011/<wbr></wbr>08/<wbr></wbr>recipe-for-climate-change/<wbr></wbr></a> and this website for rebuttals for common denialist arguments <a href="-a%20href=.html" http:>http:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>www.skepticalscience.com/<wbr></wbr>argument.php</a>"&gt;<a href="http://www.skepticalscience.com/argument.php">http:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>www.skepticalscience.com/<wbr></wbr>argument.php</a> Even if you are a global warming denialist, the fact is we are starting to run out of oil and high-grade deposits of coal and natural gas.<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20150630144808/%3Ca%20href=" http:>http:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>physics.ucsd.edu/<wbr></wbr>do-the-math/<wbr></wbr>2011/<wbr></wbr>10/<wbr></wbr>the-energy-trap/<wbr></wbr></a>"&gt;If we wait until there are dire shortages of energy resources, it will be more difficult to make the switch to alternative energy sources.</p>

<p>Unaddressed global warming will amount to to the mass violation of the human rights of tens of millions of people.Through no fault of their own whole populations will be exposed to health risks, food shortages, increased poverty and damage to their property. Coastal communities will be threatened with destruction as water levels rise. As Penn State professor Donald A. Brown stated "inadequate climate change policies must be understood to trigger human rights violations because climate change will not only make human dignity impossible for tens of millions of people around the world, including countless members of future generations, but directly threaten life itself and resources necessary to sustain life. That is, inadequate climate change policies qualify as human rights violations because of the enormity of harm to life, health, food, property, and inviolability of the right to enjoy the places where people live."(<a href="http://rockblogs.psu.edu/climate/2010/09/ethical-problems-with-cost-arguments-against-climate-change-policies-increased-costs-may-not-justify.html"></a><a href="http://rockblogs.psu.edu/climate/2010/09/ethical-problems-with-cost-arguments-against-climate-change-policies-increased-costs-may-not-justify.html">http:/<wbr></wbr>/<wbr></wbr>rockblogs.psu.edu/<wbr></wbr>climate/<wbr></wbr>2010/<wbr></wbr>09/<wbr></wbr>ethical-problems-with-cost-arguments-against-climate-change-policies-increased-costs-may-not-justify.html</a>) If the United States government did not take appropriate and rapid actions to reduce greenhouse gas pollution it would be a default on the principles set out under treaties including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</p>

<p>High CO2 fuels also come with high costs to national security. According to <a href="http://www.iags.org/costofoil.html"> a report published by the Institute for the Analysis of Global Security “the economic penalties of America's oil dependence total $297.2 to $304.9 billion annually”</a><a>. Most of those costs of importing oil come from the military and political instability the oil trade creates and exposes the United States to. Our oil dependence also exposes the United States to price manipulation by the few major oil producers. An example of this risk came in</a><a href="http://www.setamericafree.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=20&amp;Itemid=2#1"> "1973 when, in response to the Yom Kippur War, OPEC slashed production by 4.3 million barrels a day and caused a four-fold increase in oil prices"</a><a>.</a><a href="https://theojones.name/index.php/global-warming-is-leathal" rel="attachment wp-att-30"> That oil price shock was a primary trigger of the stagflation of the 1970s.</a></p>

<p>Phasing out fossil fuels will have minimal costs. A <a href="http://www.google.org/energyinnovation/growth.html"> study funded by Google found </a> that in their model investment in low CO2 energy sources "added $155 billion per year in GDP, creating 1.1 million net jobs, while reducing household energy costs by $942 per year". That study also found that "a mere five year delay in starting aggressive cost curves could cost the economy an aggregate $2.3-3.2 trillion in unrealized GDP gains, 1.2-1.4 million net jobs, and 8-28 gigatons in avoided greenhouse gas emissions by 2050".</p>

<p>Global warming will become a severe economic and human rights issue if rapid attempts to reduce fossil fuel use are not made. We have a ethical obligation to reduce CO2.</p>
